== PROJECT: RestOrRant

== Overview

_RestOrRant_ is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop restaurant management application that allows *restaurant managers, waiters and cashiers* to perform *restaurant front-end operations* more efficiently. With _RestOrRant_, restaurant managers can easily *manage table allocation, handle orders, track menu item availability and check restaurant statistics*. _RestOrRant_ was developed by a team of four, including myself, as part of our CS2103T Software Engineering module project, where we were given an addressbook application and tasked to enhance or morph it.

We decided to split the implementation of the features according to [.java]#Menu#, [.java]#Orders#, [.java]#Table# and [.java]#Statistics#. My role was to implement the menu feature end-to-end (across [.java]#Ui#, [.java]#Model#, [.java]#Logic# and [.java]#Storage# components). The following sections elaborate on my enhancements as well as the relevant updates to the User Guide and Developer Guide to reflect these enhancements.

The table below specifies the different symbols and formatting used in this Portfolio.

== Summary of contributions

This section contains a summary of my contributions to the code, documentation, and other minor enhancements made to _RestOrRant_.

* *Major enhancement*: I added the ability to add menu items to, delete menu items from and clear the menu.
** What it does:
*** `addToMenu`: The `addToMenu` command allows the user to add a menu item to the menu. The menu item must be specified with an item code, name and price using labels such as `*c/*` for code, `*n/*` for name and `*p/*` for price. For example, `addToMenu c/W09 n/Chicken Wings p/3.20` would add the [.java]#MenuItem# with [.java]#Name# Chicken Wings with [.java]#Code# W09 and [.java]#Price# 3.20 to the [.java]#Menu#.
*** `deleteFromMenu`: The `deleteFromMenu` command allows the user to delete a [.java]#MenuItem# from the [.java]#Menu#, but here the [.java]#MenuItem# is only identified by its [.java]#Code#. For example, `deleteFromMenu W09` would delete the [.java]#MenuItem# with the [.java]#Code# W09 from the [.java]#Menu#.
*** `clearMenu`: The `clearMenu` command allows the user to remove all [.java]#MenuItem# from the [.java]#Menu#.
** Justification: These commands in the menu feature would allow restaurant managers to edit the menu according to the ingredients they have available each day. The menu is also stored internally, and thus there would be no need to re-enter all the menu items but instead only add or remove a few menu items each day.
** Highlights: The format of labelling for the `addToMenu` command was used for ease of distinguishing the [.java]#Name#, [.java]#Code# and [.java]#Price# of the menu items. With the labels, users can key in any permutation of the attributes and  the command would work as intended. However, the labelling approach was not needed for the `deleteFromMenu` command as the [.java]#Code# is the only input needed.
** Credits: The addressbook given to us had originally used the labelling format for adding people to the addressbook, which is where I got my inspiration from for the `addToMenu` command.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added the ability to store the quantity ordered for each [.java]#MenuItem# in the [.java]#Menu#, and update the quantity ordered every time the [.java]#bill# is called, (implementation of `updateMenuItemQuantity` method).
** What it does: When a [.java]#MenuItem# is added for the first time, the quantity is automatically set to zero. It then updates from zero every time the orders are confirmed (i.e. when the [.java]#bill# is called).
** Justification: This enhancement is to aid the implementation of finding the most popular item in the [.java]#Menu#, by retrieving the [.java]#MenuItem# with the largest number of quantity ordered.

== Contributions to the User Guide

We had to make changes to the original addressbook User Guide with the instructions relevant to _RestOrRant_. The
following is an excerpt from our *RestOrRant User Guide* to show the updates that I have made for the menu features.

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=menumode]

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

We also had to make changes to the original addressbook Developer Guide as our implementation had major changes in the [.java]#Ui#, [.java]#Logic#, [.java]#Model# and [.java]#Storage# components. The following is an excerpt from our *RestOrRant Developer Guide* to show the updates that I have made for the menu features as well as the storage component.

In the following snippet, I explained the classes in the [.java]#Model# component that are used in the Menu feature.

The following demonstrates my technical writing skills for my implementation of the `addToMenu` command.
|====
include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=addtomenu]

|====
In the following excerpt, I explained my implementation of the `deleteFromMenu` command, and went into details for
the [.java]#Menu#getItemFromCode()# method.

Lastly, in this excerpt, I explain the main differences between the `clearMenu` and `clearOrders` command.
