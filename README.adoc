NUS graduation tracker is an application to aid School of Computing students to track their graduation progress. GradTrak is implemented to aid students in alleviating the hardships of module planning to tracking C.A.P scores so that students can focus on “student-ing”. Not to mention with the tremendous amount of uncollated information required to keep track of the graduation requirements, GradTrak is the one stop solution to solve all of these problems.

== Requirements
* GradTrak is written in *_java_* and uses *_JDK 9_* library.

== Plan Modules
* Plan when to take modules throughout your undergraduate studies
* Recommends which modules to read based on module prerequisites and specialization

== Managing C.A.P
* Tracks your C.A.P. for each semester
* Set goals for your C.A.P.
* Calculates minimum expected, maximum C.A.P. based on expected grades

== Managing Workload
* Tracks your workload for each semester
* Tracks the amount of time you spent on lecture, preparation, project and many others!

== Specializations
* Choose your course of study from one of the following three Computer Science Major programs:
** Computer Science Algorithms
** Computer Science Artificial Intelligence
** Computer Science Software Engineering
