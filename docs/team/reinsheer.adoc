== PROJECT: Fashion Match

---

== Overview

Fashion Match is a desktop wardrobe management application used as a guide for your fashion necessities. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is morphed from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[Address Book] over a period of 8 weeks. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can have greater clarity for his wardrobe and allows the user to be more aware of his usage patterns.
** Highlights: A user is able to tell his top most worn apparel, his favorite color, how clean/dirty his wardrobe is, etc.
