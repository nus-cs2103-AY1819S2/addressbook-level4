== PROJECT: The Real App

---

== Overview

*The Real App* is an enhanced desktop address book designed primarily for *real estate agents*. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Transform the model to allow for client contact and property information to be stored, modified and accessed.
** What it does: allows The Real App to treat each entry as a customer to process and store the relevant information.
** Justification: This feature forms the underlying model of The Real App and allows the user to use The Real App to store customer and real estate information.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required extensive changes to many existing components, such as `logic`, `model`, `storage` and `ui` .

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Modify `add` command to allow user to add entries into the revamped contact book.
** Modify `edit` command to allow user to edit entries in the revamped contact book.
** Transform existing `find` command into `search` command to allow user to search and retrieve information.
** Integrate new `search` command with the `archive` feature.
** Modify UI to display all the information of customers and properties.
