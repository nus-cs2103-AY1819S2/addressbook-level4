== Introduction

FomoFoto is an image processing software suite written in Java. This application is optimised for users who are *familiar with the Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while providing a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* for easy reference. The application is optimized for users who prefer text-based instructions.

For new users, jump to <<Quick Start>> for an overview on how to use FomoFoto and view the tools available.

// end::QuickStart[]


== A Walk Through
// tag::AWalkThrough[]
Let's start on our image editing journey. In this walkthrough, we will be demonstrating some simple commands to edit a sample image.

.  Head over to this https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/squirrel-photobomb-banff.jpg[link] to get a suggested sample image to start from.

.  Save the image in any desired folder you like on your device, like your Pictures folder for example. Name your image *squirrel.jpg*.

.  Start FomoFoto by referring to <<Quick Start>>.

.  Open the folder that the image file is stored in. Then, to get the file path of the image:
* In Windows: Hold on to the kbd:[Shift] key and *right click* on your image file. Click the option *Copy path*.
* In Mac: Go to terminal and navigate to your image file. Type 'pwd' to get the file path to your image file and copy paste.

.  Go back to the FomoFoto application. Import the image into FomoFoto by typing as follows:
+
.Import Command
image::import.PNG[width="912"]
+
.  Paste the file path of the image you would like to import.
* In Windows: Remove the kbd:["] and kbd:["] signs at the two ends of the file path.

.  Ensure your final command looks similar to the figure below (file path may differ):
+
.Import with Filepath
image::importCommand.PNG[width="915"]
+

.  Press kbd:[Enter] to execute the import command. Your image should be now displayed on the Album tab on the FomoFoto application as shown in the figure below.
+
.Import Success
image::importSuccess.PNG[width="917"]
+

.  Open the imported image in FomoFoto by typing as follows:
+
.Open Command
image::open.PNG[width="917"]
+

.  Press kbd:[Enter] to execute the open command. Your image should be now displayed on the FomoFoto application as shown in the figure below.
+
.Open Success
image::openImage.PNG[width="917"]
+

.  Increase the brightness of the image by typing the following command: `brightness 2.0`. This doubles the brightness of the image.

+
.Brightness Command
image::brightnessCommand.PNG[width="915"]
+

.  Press kbd:[Enter]. Your image should be brighter as shown in the figure below.
+
.Brightness Success
image::brightnessSuccess.PNG[width="917"]
+

.  Crop your image by typing the following command: `crop 310 250 140 200`. Press kbd:[Enter]. Your image should look similar to the figure below.

+
.Crop Success
image::cropSuccess.PNG[width="918"]
+

.  Save your edits by typing the command: `save`.

[[Features]]
== Features
// tag::FeaturesHeader[]
This section describes all the commands available in FomoFoto. It provides a short description of what each command does, their formats as well as examples of how to use them. The commands are listed in alphabetical order.

====
*Command Format*

The following styles are used to describe the format of the commands.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are to be replaced with what the text specifies. +
e.g. `open FILENAME`: `FILENAME` is to be replaced with the name of the file that the user wants to work on such as `open myImage.png`.
* Words in square brackets are optional values. +
e.g. `brightness [BRIGHTNESS_RATIO]`: `BRIGHTNESS_RATIO` can be omitted. Both `brightness` and `brightness 0.9` are accepted.

====

// end::FeaturesHeader[]


// tag::BlackWhiteCommand[]
=== Black and White Filter : `bw`

Applies a black and white filter on the opened image based on an integer
threshold value. If the threshold value is not specified, the black and white filter will use a preset threshold value of 127. Pixels in the image lighter than the threshold value will become white and pixels in the image darker than the threshold value will become black. The higher the threshold value, the larger the proportion of black and the smaller the proportion of white.  +
Format: `bw [THRESHOLD_VALUE]`

Examples:

* `bw` (threshold value preset to 127)
* `bw 130`
// end::BlackWhiteCommand[]

// tag::BrightnessCommand[]
=== Brightness: `brightness`

Adjusts the brightness of the opened image based on a decimal value. If the brightness value is not specified, a preset decimal value of 1.1 will be used. Any positive decimal value that is less than 1 (e.g. 0.5) will reduce the brightness of the image while any decimal value that is above 1 (e.g. 1.9) will increase the brightness of the image. Negative decimal value will not be accepted. +
Format: `brightness [BRIGHTNESS_VALUE]`

Examples:

* `brightness` (brightness decimal value is preset to 1.1 which increases the brightness slightly)
* `brightness 1.9` (increases brightness)
* `brightness 0.3` (reduces brightness)
// end::BrightnessCommand[]

// tag::ClearCommand[]
=== Clear Album: `clear`

Clears all images imported into the Album. +
Format: `clear`

[NOTE]
====
Clear does not remove the image currently being edited i.e. Images opened with the `open` command.
====
// end::ClearCommand[]

// tag::ContrastCommand[]
=== Contrast: `contrast`

Adjusts the contrast of the opened image based on a decimal value. If the contrast value is not specified, a preset decimal value of 1.1 will be used. Any positive decimal value that is lower than 1 (e.g. 0.5) will reduce the contrast of the image while any decimal value that is above 1 (e.g. 1.9) will increase the contrast of the image. Negative decimal value will not be accepted. +
Format: `contrast [CONTRAST_VALUE]`

Examples:

* `contrast` (contrast decimal value is preset to 1.1 which increases the contrast slightly)
* `contrast 1.4` (increases contrast)
* `contrast 0.3` (reduces contrast)
// end::ContrastCommand[]


=== Crop an Image : `crop`
// tag::CropCommand[]
Crops an image based on given top left hand corner coordinates, width and height of final cropped image wanted. +
Format: `crop X_POINTCOORD Y_POINTCOORD WIDTH HEIGHT`

Displays help view to user.
Format: `help`

// tag::Import[]

=== Import an Image : `import`

Imports images to FomoFoto's Album from a specified file path or a folder. +
Format: `import FILEPATH`

Example of single file path import:

* `import C:\Users\Addison\Desktop\sample.jpg`
* `import C:\Home\sample.png`

Example of folder import:

* `import C:\Users\Addison\Desktop`
* `import C:\Home`

For folder import, invalid files are skipped and only valid images will be imported.

[NOTE]
Images should be of the following formats: `bmp`, `jpg` , `jpeg`, `png`, `tif`, `tiff` or `gif`. Images with `tif` or `tiff` formats are not rendered on screen due to a bug with Java but edits made will still be applied.

Additionally, images must also adhere to the following additional requirements:

. Not be hidden or prepended by a `.` dot identifier.
. Not be over 10MB in size.
. Not have the same name as an existing image in the Album.
