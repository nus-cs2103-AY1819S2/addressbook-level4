== Overview
I am a software developer and second year computer science student at the National University of Singapore. I am really passionate about developing technology that can make the world a better place. This portfolio page documents my contributions to one of the most meaningful projects I've worked for - HealthHub.

== Project: Health Hub

=== About the project

image::HealthHub.png[width=800]

HealthHub is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface[command-line] desktop application built by my team and I, for our Software Engineering project.
We chose to morph it to a home-care patient management system, because of our passion in the health care industry. This enhanced application allows Hospital Administrators and senior management to create, assign and organise patient records seamlessly. HealhHub also organises staff information and manages statistics to assist in the Hospital's planning and allocation of resources.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

`add` A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application. +
`Request` Red text beginning with a capital letter indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Created the `Request` class to encapsulate a request, and it's relevant CRUD commands.
** What it does: Encapsulates the necessary information to be stored in a patient request.
** Justification: Laid the foundation to the entire project. All components of our project (UI, Storage, Logic and Model) required the creation of a `Request` class for further development of core functionality.
** Highlights: This enhancement affecting all existing classes, requiring some overhaul of the existing code base and thorough interaction of the differing components.

//* *Major enhancement*: Created `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `list` and `clear` commands for the `Request` class.
//** What it does: Lays the foundation to any `Request` based functionality. Allows the user to organise the requests made by the patients seamlessly.
//** Justification: These enhancements provide necessary features to the admin so that the admin can create, edit or delete requests at any point of time.
//** Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing existing classes, like the [blue]`Healthworker` class. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was also challenging as it required changes to existing commands and classes, during the integration-testing phase.
//** Credits: Utilised the JACKSon library that serializes a [blue]`Request` object into JSON format for storage. This allows the user's state to be saved at all times.

* *Major enhancement*: Created `assign` and `complete` request commands.
** What it does: Allows the admin to assign Healthworkers to requests, and complete any ongoing requests.
** Justification: These features are necessary for the product, and allows the administrator manage all patient requests by assigning the relevant healthworker with the appropriate skill sets.
** Highlights: Creation of these features required thorough understanding of how the existing details of the [blue]`Logic` and [blue]`Model` components,
as knowledge of how information is cached in the application's memory was essential to allow for rapid assigning. Also implemented a scheduling algorithm that allows users to ensure that requests assigned to `HealthWorker`s are at least 2 hours apart.
This prevents the user from accidentally assigning the same Healthworker to requests with clashing times.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a filter command that allows the user to navigate through all requests stored by filtering by a specific value.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=daviddl9&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-12&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Reposense]]

== Contributions to the User Guide

=== *Filter requests*:

Format: `filter request <keyword> [<more_keywords>]`

Shortcut(s): +
1. `filter r <keyword> [<more_keywords>]` +
2. `filter 2 <keyword> [<more_keywords>]`

where `[<more_keywords]` refer to the fields you would like to search for.

After entering the command with valid inputs, you will see the entire list of requests whose fields match
 the parameters specified in the command. To filter requests, you can specify any of the following filtering criteria:
`dt/DATE`, `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE`, `st/STATUS`, `i/NRIC`, `c/CONDITION`. Note that you can also chain multiple criteria together to get a more specific
filter result.

For example, let's say you want to filter all the requests made by the patient with `NRIC` S9123456G that have been *completed*. You
can simply enter the command: `filter request i/S9123456A st/COMPLETED`, and the request list panel to the left of the screen would update to
show you all the requests you are looking for.

Before:

image::filterrequestbefore.png[width=200]
Figure 5.5.2.1 shows the request list prior to executing the `filter request` command

After:

image::filterrequestafter.png[width=200]

Figure 5.5.2.2 shows the request list after executing `filter request i/S9123456A st/COMPLETED`

The request list panel on the left would filter to show just the requests queried by the user.

[NOTE]
If there are no such requests that match the user's query, an empty list would be show on the left panel.

{nbsp}

*Notes*:

* The search is *case insensitive* for all fields apart from specialisation(e.g
`hans` will match `Hans`), and the *order of the keywords* does not matter(e.g
`Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`).

* Search using partial words will return all results with fields containing
that subword. (e.g `filter request n/Tan` may return people with the surnames Tan or
Tang)

* Note that to filter by status, the status has to be spelt out in *full*.
e.g `filter r st/pending`


{nbsp}

[TIP]
====
Multiple conditions for filtering requests can be added
simultaneously for more expressive search.

Example:

`filter r n/<name> p/<phone>`
filters the request list for requests whose patient's name contains the
specified name substring *and* the specified phone number.
====

[NOTE]
====
To revert the view back to the original request list, enter the `list request` command.
====

Examples:

* `filter request n/alice` +
Returns all patients whose name contains "alice".
* `filter r p/9177` +
Returns all requests with contacts numbers that have "9177" in it's field.
* `filter 2 dt/30-01-2019 10:00:00` +
Returns all requests scheduled on 30th Jan 2019, at 10 am sharp.

=== Filtering requests within a specific date range
Let's say you've grown to have an overwhelming number of requests, because you've been doing so successfully! Suppose you now would like to
look back and take a look at the requests that you had over a specific date range. You can do so using the following command:

Format: `filter request dt/start dt/end` +
Shortcut(s): +
1. `filter r dt/start dt/end` +
2. `filter 2 dt/start dt/end`

*Examples:*

* `filter r dt/01-01-2019 00:00:00 dt/01-06-2019` 00:00:00 +
filters the requests between 1st Jan 2019 (inclusive) and 1st June 2019 (exclusive).

=== Assign Request feature

The assign request feature allows an administrator to assign a request to a particular healthworker.

==== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence flow from the `LogicManager` to the `ModelManager` when a user enters a `assign request` command:

image::assignreq.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.1 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` component interactions for `assign request` command.

image::assignReqToHw.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.2 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` and `Model` component interactions for [blue]`AssignRequestCommand`.

image::addHwRequestDates.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.3 Sequence diagram illustrates addition of the relevant `Date` objects into the `TreeSet<Date>` of the `healthWorker`.

image::checkConflictingRequests.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.4 Sequence diagram illustrates interaction between `AssignRequestCommand` and `healthWorkerAppointments`

1. When `LogicManager` receives the `execute` command, it calls the `parseCommand` method in `RequestBookParser`.
2. `RequestBookParser` will receive `assign` as the command and instantiate `AssignRequestCommandParser` to further parse the command.
3. If the arguments specified in the `assign` command are invalid, a `AssignCommand` will be created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.
4. `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute` command of `AssignCommand`
5. `AssignRequestCommand` will proceed to call the `getFilteredRequestList` method of `Model`.
6. Iterate through the `requestIds`, if valid, add the `request` corresponding to that `index` to the set of `Request`.
7. Iterates through all the requests already assigned to that `healthWorker`. If there is a conflict of schedule (i.e Requests assigned
to that healthWorker are less than 2 hours apart), a `CommandException` is thrown.
8. Writes the updated request to the `RequestBook` in `ModelManager`, if all the request timings are valid.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Algorithm in ensuring no clashing requests assigned to healthworkers - Data Structure and implementation
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Using a Balanced Binary Search Tree (java `TreeSet`) to keep track of the [blue]`RequestDate` of each request attended to by a particular `healthWorker`.
** Reasoning: Since the allowed time interval between 2 consecutive requests should be at least 2 hours, we can take advantage
of of this by only keeping track of the start time of requests. Hence we can utilise the `ceiling()`, `contains()` and `floor()` methods of the `TreeSet`, which runs effeciently in O(log N) time (where N is the number of requests). Here is the code snippet that implements this:
```
    // Note: healthWorkerAppointments is the TreeSet that stores the appointment dates
    Date date = request.getRequestDate().getDate();
    calendar.setTime(date);
    calendar.add(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, -MIN_REQUEST_DURATION); // MIN_REQUEST_DURATION = 2 hours
    Date lowerLimit = calendar.getTime();
    calendar.add(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 2 * MIN_REQUEST_DURATION);
    Date upperLimit = calendar.getTime();

    if (healthWorkerAppointments.contains(date) || (healthWorkerAppointments.lower(date) != null
          && healthWorkerAppointments.lower(date).after(lowerLimit))
          || (healthWorkerAppointments.higher(date) != null
          && healthWorkerAppointments.ceiling(date).before(upperLimit))) {
              throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_HEALTHWORKER_OCCUPIED_CANNOT_ASSIGN);
    }

    healthWorkerAppointments.add(date);
```
Here is a pictorial representation of the algorithm:

image::assignRegionCheck.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.5 Shows the visualisation of time ranges that are valid.

* Alternative 2: For each request to be assigned, manually iterate through the Request list to ensure that there are not clashing dates.
Pros: Easy to implement
Cons: Slow - in the worst case, if all the requests get assigned at once, this operation will run in O(n^2) time.

=== Add Request feature

==== Current Implementation
The `add request` command allows the `LogicManager` to create a new request and add it to the list of requests. Adding a new request requires the
patient's name, patient's phone number, patient's address, patient's NRIC number and the patient's conditions. The format of the add request command is
add request n/NAME p/PHONE i/NRIC a/ADDRESS dt/DATETIME c/CONDITION.

The following sequence shows the sequence when the add command is execute by the LogicManager:

image::addrequest.png[width=800]
Figure 3.2.1.1 Sequence Diagram for `add request` command

From the diagram above:

.  `LogicManager` 's execute is called when the administrator keys in `add request` and it calls upon `parseCommand` of `HealthHubParser` to parse the command
.  `HealthHubParser` will initialize `AddCommandParser` and invoke the method `parse` to further parse the command.
.  `parse` will be invoked and passed the parameters of the add command.
.  If all the arguments of the `add` commands are valid, `AddRequestCommand` will be returned to the `LogicManager`
.  `LogicManger` will then calls the method `execute` method of `AddRequestCommand`
.  `AddRequestCommand` will call `addRequest` passing `Request` as an argument to `Model` and after calls `commitRequestBook` method from `Model`, if all the arguments in the `Request` are valid.
.  A `CommandResult` will be returned at the end.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data Structure for the list of Requests
* **Alternative 1 (Current Approach):** Using a `UniqueRequestList`
** Pros: The comparison is not as rigid. You can create requests with similar names/phones as long as it passes a less stringent criteria.
** Cons: You need additional overhead. You need to create an extra class and function to check.

* **Alternative 2:** Using a `Set`
** Pros: Do not need an extra function. You can use use `equals` for comparison
** Cons: It is a strict check and as a result you will not be allowed to create requests with same phone/same name etc.

===== Aspect: Data Structure of `Request`
* **Alternative 1 (Current Approach):** All parameters in `Request` are abstracted out to have a class of its own.
** Pros: It adheres to the Single Responsibility Principles (SRP) and the Separation of Concerns (SoC) as each parameter checks whether it is valid
** Cons: Many different classes are created which increases the complexity of the code

* **Alternative 2:** Store all parameters of `Request` as `String`
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Violates SRP as one single class will need to check if the arguments are valid.

[NOTE]
The `RequestStatus` class within the `Request` object utilises the Java `Enum` to ensure type safety in user inputs.

The implementation of the `RequestStatus` class is as follows:

```
    private enum Status {
        PENDING,
        ONGOING,
        COMPLETED
    }

     public RequestStatus(String status) {
         this.requestState = Status.valueOf(status);
     }
```

Through this, any user String that is passed in as an argument for the `RequestStatus` field is automatically type checked,
ensuring that there are no invalid request statuses entered.
