* PocketProject (Project Manager)

* This is a desktop Project Manager application. Most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface)
and there is   also a GUI to support the system. It is an application using Java as the main programming language.

* It is intended for managers who are in charge of many software engineering projects and who have a large number of
employees assigned to each project at any given time.

* Managers can view details of their projects and employees such as:
** Employee
*** Employee's name, phone number and email
*** Employee's github profile
*** Projects an employee is working on

** Project
*** Deadline
*** Client
*** Milestones
*** User stories
*** Project tasks
