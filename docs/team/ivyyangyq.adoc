== PROJECT: ClubManager

---

=== Overview
This portfolio documents the features and enhancements that I have made to the project and the contributions I have made to
the User and Developer guide.

ClubManager is a desktop application for NUS CCA management. It is specially designed for *CCA main committee members* to manage their CCA data. It is the
go-to application for CCA leaders who are looking for a software that allows them to *manage their members and activities*.

=== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Activity List Management feature*
** What it does: Manages the list of activities that a club has. This feacture includes functions such as: +
*** Adding activities to (`activityAdd`) and removing activities from (`activityDelete`) the activity list.
*** Finding activities that match some given criteria (`activityFind`) and filtering the activities based on the how recent
the activities are (`activityFilter`).
*** Listing all activities (`activityList`)
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because in addition to manage members in the club,
the app can manage another common aspect in club affairs - the activities.
** Highlights: This enhancement involves all commands that manages the activity list, including `activityAdd`, `activityDelete`,
 `activityList`, `activityFind` and `activityFilter`.
The implementation of the activity list is automatically sorted and ordered based on completion status and time.
The order is from Ongoing to Completed, within the same status the activities are ordered by the earliest to the latest.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Update UI display for activity list and activity details. https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w13-2/main/pull/154[#154]
** Update Storage for storing attendance in activity.
