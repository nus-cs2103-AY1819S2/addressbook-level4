== Introduction +
The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my software engineering competency by showcasing my code and documentation contributions to the link:{repoURL}[BrainTrain project].

=== Overview +
The BrainTrain project was developed by a team of 5 students over seven weeks, under the National University of Singapore's link:{seeduURL}[CS2103T: Software Engineering module]. +

CS2103T students were given the option of enhancing an link:{seeduURL}[existing addressbook application] or morphing it into another product. We chose to morph it into a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[spaced-repetition] card application because we wanted to further challenge ourselves and improve our software engineering skills.

=== What is BrainTrain +

BrainTrain is a *spaced-repetition card application* which makes *memorizing easy and effective*. With BrainTrain's link:https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/23/spaced-repetition-a-hack-to-make-your-brain-store-information[Spaced Repetition System (SRS)] optimizing your card revision intervals, you will be able to *learn more in less time*.

== Summary of contributions +
My primary responsibility was to design and develop the *Card Management System*. My secondary responsibility was to act as the project's *documentation lead*. In the following sub-sections, you will find a summary of my key contributions to the project.

=== Major enhancement +
My largest contribution to the project was the implementation of the *Card Management System*: +

* Context: In BrainTrain, each lesson contains a set of cards of the same type and topic.
* What it does: It provides users with the ability to add, edit and delete lessons in *Lesson View* and *Card View* modes.
* In *Lesson View*, users can:
** Add and delete lessons by using the `addLesson` and `deleteLesson` commands
** Open a lesson in *Card View* for editing by using the `edit` command
** List the full details of all lessons by using the `listLessons` command
* In *Card View*, users can:
** Add and delete cards by using the `addCard` and `deleteCard` commands
** Set the 2 test values to be tested in quiz mode for all cards in the lesson by using the `set` command
** List the full details of all cards by using the `listCards` command
** Quit *Card View* and return to *Lesson View* by using the `quit` command
* Justification: Users need to be able to create and manage content in order to use BrainTrain for card learning.
* Most significant pull requests: link:{pullURL}113[#113], link:{pullURL}173[#173] and link:{pullURL}180[#180]
* Code contributed: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=digipie[View on RepoSense] +

=== Minor enhancement +
My second largest contribution was the Graphical User Interface (GUI) representation for the Card Management System: +

* What it does: Displays all lessons and their relevant details in *Lesson View*, and the details and cards of the lesson being edited in *Card View*.
** In *Lesson View*, users can view all lessons and their details (e.g. number of cards).
** In *Card View*, users can view the opened lesson's details and its cards.
* Justification: The GUI representation of lessons and cards provides users with the ability to view all relevant details at a glance.
* Code contributed: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=digipie[View on RepoSense] +

=== Other contributions +
In addition to designing and writing code, I also contributed to the project through the following means:

* *Documentation:*
As the documentation lead, I ensured overall quality for the project's documentation by,
** Writing the User Guide's Introduction and Quick Start sections (see link:{pullURL}15[#15], link:{pullURL}85[#85], and link:{pullURL}180[#180]).
** Editing the User Guide and Developer Guide for overall coherency as editor (see
link:{pullURL}20[#20], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-link:{pullURL}85[#85], and link:{pullURL}180[#180]).
* *Project management:* I assisted the team lead, <<eugenefdw#, Eugene>> by,
** Managing product releases link:{repoURL}/releases/tag/v1.2.1[v1.2.1] and link:{repoURL}/releases/tag/v1.3[v1.3.0].
** Coordinating team for milestone link:{repoURL}/milestone/4[v1.3].
* *Software architecture:* I contributed to the overall project by,
** Performing major refactor of `seedu.address.logic` and `seedu.address.model.util` package structure and design to improve workflow for entire team (see  link:{pullURL}/85[#85], link:{pullURL}/180[#180]).
** Co-designing the app's light and dark theme with fellow developer <<halcyoneee#, Tze Ting>> (see link:{pullURL}180[#180]).
* *Community:* I worked with my team to resolve problems together by,
** Assisting teammates in fixing their bugs (see link:{pullURL}33[#33] and link:{pullURL}97[#97]).
** Reviewing teammates' pull requests with constructive feedback (see link:{pullURL}37[#37], link:{pullURL}139[#139] and link:{pullURL}175[#175]).

== Contributions to the user guide +
I have listed some of my key contributions to the link:{webURL}UserGuide.html[user guide] as excerpts below: +

=== Excerpt: Adding a lesson: `addLesson` +
_Click link:{webURL}UserGuide.html#addLesson[here] to view this section in the user guide._

Adds a lesson which is used to store cards of the same type and topic. +
Format: `addLesson n/NAME t/TEST t/TEST [t/TEST]... [h/HINT]...`

[NOTE]
====
This command only works in lesson view. If you are currently editing a lesson in card view, you have to use the <<quit, `quit`>> command to return to lesson view before you can use this command.
====

Usage rules:

* You must specify at least 2 `TEST` values. Flashcards added to this lesson must have corresponding `TEST` values.
** For example, a lesson for memorising _muscle anatomy_ will have three `TEST` values: 'Muscle', 'Action' and 'Innervation'.
** By default, the first 2 `TEST` values ('Muscle' and 'Action') will be tested when the lesson is started in quiz mode.
** You can set the 2 `TEST` values to be tested by using the <<set, `set`>> command.
* You can specify 0 or more `HINT` values (e.g. 'Muscle Group').
** `HINT` values are displayed during quiz mode when you enter <<hint, `\hint`>>.

Examples:

* `addLesson n/Capitals of the world t/Country t/Capital t/Language h/Hint`
** Adds a lesson named 'Capitals of the world' with 3 `TEST` values and 1 `HINT` value.
* `addLesson n/Chinese vocabulary t/English t/Chinese`
** Adds a lesson named 'Chinese vocabulary' with 2 `TEST` values.

=== Excerpt: Editing a lesson in card view: `edit` +
_Click link:{webURL}UserGuide.html#openLesson[here] to view this section in the user guide._

Editing a lesson in card view: `edit` +
Opens the lesson at the specified INDEX in Card View for editing. +
Format: `openLesson INDEX`

[NOTE]
====
In Card View, users will be able to use the following commands: <<set, `set`>>, <<addCard, `addCard`>>, <<deleteCard, `deleteCard`>> and <<listCards, `listCards`>>.
====

Example:

.BrainTrain with sample lessons loaded
image::edit_lesson.png[width=384]

In the above scenario, the command `edit 1` will open the first lesson in the numbered list, 'Sample-Capitals' in Card View for editing.

=== Excerpt: Deleting a card: `deleteCard` +
_Click link:{webURL}UserGuide.html#deleteCard[here] to view this section in the user guide._

Deletes the card at the specified INDEX of the numbered card list. +
Format: `deleteCard INDEX`

[NOTE]
====
This command only works in card view. You have to open a lesson in card view for editing with the <<edit, `edit`>> command before you can use this command.
====

Example:

.BrainTrain with sample cards loaded
image::delete_card.png[width=384]

In the above scenario, the command `deleteCard 2` will delete the second card in the numbered list, 'Orbicularis oculi / Facial nerve'.

== Contributions to the developer guide +
I have listed some of my key contributions to the link:{webURL}DeveloperGuide.html[developer guide] as excerpts below: +

=== Excerpt: Management feature (overview) +
_Click link:{webURL}DeveloperGuide.html#mgtOverview[here] to view this section in the developer guide._

Management feature provides users with the ability to add, edit and delete lessons in *Lesson View* and *Card View* modes.

==== Lesson View +
In *Lesson View*, users can:

* `addLesson` - Adds a lesson to the list of lessons loaded in-memory.
* `deleteLesson` - Deletes a lesson from the list of lessons loaded in-memory.
* `edit` - Opens a lesson in *Card View* for editing
* `listLessons` - Lists all cards with full details

{empty} +

==== Card View +
In *Card View*, users can:

* `addCard` - Adds a card to the lesson opened in *Card View*.
* `deleteCard` - Deletes a card from the lesson opened in *Card View*.
* `set` - Sets the 2 test values to be tested in quiz mode for all cards in the lesson
* `listCards` - Lists all cards with full details
* `quit` - Quits *Card View* and returns to *Lesson View*

In the subsequent sub-sections, I will discuss the 3 major model classes used to manage lessons and flashcards, `Card.java`, `Lesson.java`, and `LessonList.java`. These classes are also used by the <<lessonStorageFeature, Lesson Storage Feature>> and <<sessionFeature, Session Feature>>.

=== Excerpt: Card class +
_Click link:{webURL}DeveloperGuide.html#cardClass[here] to view this section in the developer guide._

An instance of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/card/Card.java[`Card.java`] represents a flashcard which contains 2 or more test values and 0 or more hint values. It takes in a list of test values, and optionally a list of hint values.

The following code shows how the card is generated:

[NOTE]
====
Test and hint values are referred to as core and optional values internally. These terms are interchangeable.
====

[source,java]
----
/**
  * Creates a {@code Card} which represents a flash card.
  *
  * @param cores {@link #cores} a {@code Card} must have.
  * @param optionals {@link #optionals} a {@code Card} can have.
  */
 public Card(List<String> cores, List<String> optionals) {
     requireAllNonNull(cores, optionals);
     this.cores = new ArrayList<>();
     this.cores.addAll(cores);
     this.optionals = new ArrayList<>();
     this.optionals.addAll(optionals);
     hashCode = generateHashCode();
 }

 /**
  * Creates a {@code Card} which represents a flash card.
  *
  * @param cores {@link #cores} a {@code Card} must have.
  */
 public Card(List<String> cores) {
     // Generates a Card without optionals.
 }
----

These 2 constructors are called by the `Lesson.java` which generates a list of cards.

=== Excerpt: Add card command: `addCard` +
_Click link:{webURL}DeveloperGuide.html#addCard[here] to view this section in the developer guide._

The `addCard` command adds a card to the lesson which is being edited in *Card View*. +

For example:

* Given a lesson on country capitals which has 2 test values, 'Country' and 'Capital', and 1 hint value, 'Hint'.
* If a user wants to add a flashcard to this lesson, he would enter `addCard t/Korea t/Seoul h/S`.

How it will look like to the user after entering the command:

.Expected result after the card is added

Given the above example, the following sequence of interactions will occur within the `Logic` component.

=== Excerpt: Aspect: contextual management commands +
_Click link:{webURL}DeveloperGuide.html#mgtConsiderations[here] to view this section in the developer guide._

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only lesson-related commands are allowed in *Lesson View* sub-management mode, and only card-related commands are allowed in *Card View* sub-management mode.
** Pros: The user need not specify which lesson he is adding or deleting cards from. It is clear which lesson is currently being edited.
** Con: Tedious to implement given that it requries significant refactoring of the base code provided.

* **Alternative 2:** A single management mode where all lesson and card-related commands can be executed.
** Pro: This is significantly easier to implement give that no major refactoring is requred.
** Con: This compromises the user experience.

**Alternative 1** was chosen because it will vastly improve the user experience. For example, if a user were to need to add multiple cards to a specific lesson, alternative 2 would require the user to enter the lesson's index or name for each `addCard` command (e.g. `addCard n/Sample-Capitals t/Korea t/Seoul` where 'Sample-Capitals' is the lesson's name). +

On the other hand, alternative 1 only requires the user to open the lesson for editing in *Card View* once, before calling the `addCard` commands. These `addCard` commands will not require the user to specify which lesson to add the cards to. +

Hence by choosing alternative 1, the user experience was vastly improved given that the user interface is easier to use.
