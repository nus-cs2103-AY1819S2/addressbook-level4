== Welcome to the Food Diary

image::developerguide.png[float=right, width="450"]
Welcome to the *Food Diary*! The *Food Diary* is a desktop app for storing your personal food reviews and obtain food recommendations based on your past reviews.

This developer guide contains information on the mechanics of all of the features of the *Food Diary* and is thus suited for developers of all levels to learn the inner workings of our application and how to effectively build on them.

If you would like to improve on the *Food Diary*, here's a good place to start!

**Callouts**

Callouts are boxes with important information regarding the usage of the Food Diary. These 3 callouts are used throughout our User Guide.
[NOTE]
This is a *note*. A note indicates important additional information that should be read.

[TIP]
This is a *tip*. A tip indicates good to know information that would improve your user experience

[WARNING]
This is a *warning*. A warning indicates critical information that would affect the functionality of this programme.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your restaurantal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteRestaurant.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagramV1.3.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RestaurantListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel`, `ReviewListPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a restaurant).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteRestaurantSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagramV1.3.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Food Diary data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Restaurant>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Food Diary`, which `Restaurant` can reference. This would allow `Food Diary` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Restaurant` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagramV1.2.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Food Diary data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


// tag::listUnvisitedDG[]
=== listUnvisited feature which sorts Restaurants by distance to a specified postal code
==== Current Implementation
The `listUnvisited` feature accepts a postal code as user input and displays restaurants without reviews nearest to the user's inputted postal code.

The implementation of this feature can be broken down into 3 main components.

*1) Storage Component*

*2) Model Component*

*3) Logic Component*

The implementations of these components will be discussed below.


*[.underline]#1. Storage Component#*

The `Storage` component's function is to serialise the JSON data file `PostalData.json`, which contains the x and y-coordinates of every postal code in Singapore as of 13/03/2019.
The data is serialised into `JsonSerializablePostalData` which contains a `List` of `JsonAdaptedPostalData`.
This data can be retrieved through the `StorageManager#getPostalData()` method.

[NOTE]
In order to update the PostalData.json, you can run the script found https://github.com/chanqingzhou/postalDataScript[here].


*[.underline]#2. Model Component#*

The `Model` component's function is to allow the retrieval of the `PostalData` of a specific postal code.
It contains a `PostalDataSet` which contains a `HashMap` of `String` representing the postal code mapped to the corresponding `PostalData`.
This contains the x and y-coordinates of the corresponding postal code.
The retrieval is done through the `PostalDataSet#getPostalData(int postal)` method.
`PostalDataSet` is obtained through the `Model#getPostalDataSet()` interface.


*[.underline]#3.Logic Component#*

The `Logic` component consists of two key sub-components, the `Command` component and the `Comparator` component.
The `Command` component parses the user input into a `Postal` and then checks if the `Postal` is within the `PostalDataSet`.
If the postal code provided is not within `PostalDataSet`, the `ListUnvisitedCommand` will simply filter out unreviewed restaurants.
Otherwise, if the postal code is valid, it will create a new `SortDistanceComparator<Restaurant>` class with the postal code and `PostalDataSet` inputted as the parameters.
This `SortDistanceComparator` is then passed to the `Model` class to sort the `SortedList` which encapsulates the `FilteredList`.
This sequence is illustrated in the activity diagram below.

image::ListUnvisitedLogicActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `SortDistanceComparator<Restaurant>` class sorts the `Restaurant` based on the distance to the user's inputted postal code.
It does this by first querying the `PostalData` of the postal code of the `Restaurant` from `PostalDataSet` then
calculating the distance from the user inputted postal code.
This result is then stored within the `Comparator` class.
[NOTE]
If a `Restaurant` 's postal code is not in `PostalDataSet`, the distance will be set to `Double.MAX_VALUE`.
This implies that this `Restaurant` will appear at the bottom of the `SortedList`.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how 3 components behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `PostalDataSet` will be initialised with data from `PostalData.json`
through the `Storage` component.

Step 2. The user calls `listUnvisited po/267951`. The `listUnvisitedCommand` class will be initialised.
A new `SortDistanceComparator` will be created by the
`listUnvisitedCommand` class containing the `PostalData` of '267951'.
The command will then call the method `Model#filterAndSort(Predicate PREDICATE_SHOW_UNVISITED_RESTAURANTS, Comparator sortBy).`
[NOTE]
If the postal code provided by the user is invalid, there will be no change in ordering of the `Restaurant`. The list of `Restaurant` will be filtered to only show `Restaurant` without any `Review`.


Step 3. The `Model#filterAndSortByLocation()` will first filter the `filterList` to show all `Restaurants` with zero reviews.

Step 4. The `sortedList` which encapsulates the `filteredList` will then be sorted based on the `Comparator`
provided to show the nearest `Restaurants` with zero review.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes a listUnvisited Command.

image::ListUnvisitedSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How is location data accessed for each postal code?

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Preload the data from a json file
** Pros: Internet Service is not required.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Making a API call to an external library e.g.Google API
** Pros: Will use less memory and will always be updated and accurate.
** Cons: Internet Service is required for the usage of the feature.

===== Aspect: Accessing of local postal data

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `PostalData` is retrieved for each `Restaurant` by the `Comparator`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Increased coupling between `Logic` and `Model`. There might also be performance issues.
* **Alternative 2:** Using the x and y coordinates as a field in the Restaurant class
** Pros: Repeated calls to retrieve the `PostalData` from `PostalDataSet` is not required.
** Cons: If incorrect postal data is provided, the incorrect x and y coordinates will be written to the data file. This may be difficult to correct.
// end::listUnvisitedDG[]

// tag::selectSortDG[]
=== Display of Restaurants and Restaurant Details

In order to enhance user's experience in the Food Diary, the `select` feature is enhanced and a new `sort` feature is implemented.
These two features complete the diary aspect of the application by generating total visits and average ratings from the user's own reviews and allowing users to sort the restaurants to see their favourite ones.
This section describes the implementation of these two features.

==== Select Feature

The `select` feature displays a restaurant's summary and reviews when it is selected.
The restaurant's summary is made up its generated data, the average rating and total visits, which are calculated from the reviews of a restaurant in the `Summary` class.

===== Current Implementation
The `select` feature is a pre-existing one from AddressBook Level 4.
The enhancement made is to display greater quantity and quality of restaurant information upon selection.

You can refer to _Figure 1_ to see the chain of activities that happen when the `select` command is executed.

image::SelectActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]
_Figure 1. Activity Diagram for `select` command_

The following describes how the `select` mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. User executes `select INDEX` command, with `INDEX` as a positive integer within the range of indexes in the filtered restaurant list.

Step 2. The `FoodDiaryParser` parses the user's input and constructs a `SelectCommandParser` object, which then parses the input index into an `Index` object and constructs a `SelectCommand` object.

Step 3. The `SelectCommand` is executed and calls on `Model#setSelectedRestaurant()` to set the selected restaurant to be the restaurant with the target `Index` in the current filtered restaurant list.

Step 4. The listeners in the `RestaurantSummaryPanel` and `ReviewListPanel` pick up the new value of the selected restaurant and loads the restaurant's summary and reviews respectively onto the GUI.
The `RestaurantSummaryPanel` does so by calling its own `RestaurantSummaryPanel#loadSummary()` operation, which retrieves the selected restaurant's attributes such as `Summary`, and through it,
the restaurant's `avgRating` and `totalVisit`.

[NOTE]
A restaurant with no reviews is indicated with `totalVisits` = 0 and `avgRating` = -1. The number -1 is chosen as all user input `Ratings` can only be a number between [0, 5], thus -1 is a clear
indication that there is no `avgRating` for the particular restaurant. This is a clear check to decide whether the `avgRating` field displayed in the UI should be `N.A.`.

[NOTE]
There is no state change to the Food Diary as the `select` command only selects a restaurant from the current `FilteredList` of restaurants.
As such, this command cannot be undone or redone through the `undo` and `redo` commands respectively.

You can refer to _Figure 2_ for the internal implementation flow when a `select` command is executed.

image::SelectSequenceDiagram.png[width="675"]
_Figure 2. Sequence Diagram for `select` command_

===== Design Considerations

Two guiding design patterns are applied to this feature:

- The Facade design pattern is used to allow access to `avgRating` and `totalVisits` of a `Restaurant` only through its `Summary` class.

- The Observer pattern is also applied in the UI component as the `RestaurantSummaryPanel` and `ReviewListPanel` gets updated automatically once the selected restaurant is changed through the use of a listener for `selectedRestaurant`.

====== Aspect: How to structure the Summary in the UI

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement `Summary` as a class in the `Restaurant` package
** Pros: Applies Observer pattern and reduces duplicate code as calculation of `avgRating` only has to be done once in `Summary` class to display it on both `RestaurantCard` and `RestaurantSummaryPanel`.
** Cons: Results in coupling as it introduces dependency of `Summary` on `Review` class.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement `Summary` as a class in the UI component that listens to changes in the `Review` of the `Restaurant`
** Pros: Reduces dependency within Model component.
** Cons: Increases duplicate code as `avgRating` of a Restaurant's `Summary` is displayed in both the `RestaurantCard` and `RestaurantSummaryPanel` and will thus have to be calculated twice.

==== Sort Feature

The `sort` feature allows users to sort the restaurants in the Food Diary in ascending or descending order of ratings, and even limit the number of top/bottom ranked Restaurants shown.

===== Current Implementation
The command format is `sort [or/ORDER] [l/LIMIT]` with optional `ORDER` and `LIMIT` parameters.
By default, the restaurants would be sorted in descending order of ratings with no limit applied.

You can refer to _Figure 3_ below for a better understanding of the activity flow of the `sort` command.

image::SortActivityDiagram.png[width="700"]
_Figure 3. Activity Diagram for `sort` command_

The majors components involved in the implementation of this feature are:

- `FoodDiaryParser`, which parses the user's input and constructs a `SelectCommandParser`, which then parses the input into `Order` and `Limit` and constructs a `SortCommand`.

- `SortRating`, which implements `Comparator<Restaurant>`, serves as a comparator to sort the restaurants in the Food Diary by its `avgRating`.
To construct this comparator, an `Order` has to be passed in to determine whether `SortRating#compare()` will be indicating ascending or descending order.

- `SortCommand`, contains 2 sub-classes, `Order` and `Limit`, which are used for the construction of `SortCommand`.
`SortCommand` is where the `SortRating` comparator is constructed and passed into the `Model#sortRestaurantList()` operation. The filtering of the sorted list to the `Limit`, if present, also takes place here.


The following shows how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `sort [or/ORDER] [l/LIMIT]` command.

Step 2. The `FoodDiaryParser` parses the user's input and constructs a `SortCommandParser` object, which then parses the inputs into `Order` and `Limit` objects, and constructs a `SortCommand` object using the `Order` and `Limit` constructed.

[NOTE]
If there is no order in the user's input, the default `Order` will be constructed using the String `"DES"`.

[NOTE]
If there is no limit in the user's input, an `Optional.empty()` object will be used in place of `Limit` in the construction of a `SortCommand` object.

Step 3. The `SortCommand` is executed.

- Step 3.1. A `SortRating` comparator is constructed and `Model#sortRestaurantList()` call to sort the list of restaurants in the Food Diary.

- Step 3.2. If `Limit` is present, `SortCommand#filterToLimit()` is called to get a `uniqueRatings` list from `Model#getUniqueRatings()` to get the borderline of the `avgRatings` to be included in the filtered list.
A predicate containing the borderline `avgRating` is then created and passed into `Model#updateFilteredRestaurantList()` to filter the sorted restaurant list. Else, if `Limit` is not present, the predicate passed
into `Model#updateFilteredRestaurantList()` to display all restaurants.

Step 4. The sorted restaurant list is then stored in the Food Diary via `Model#commitFoodDiary()`.

You can refer to _Figure 4_ below for a more detailed idea of how `sort` command is implemented internally.

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="750"]
_Figure 4. Sequence Diagram for `sort` command_


===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How to apply the `Limit`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let `Limit` denote the number of ranks of restaurants to be displayed
** Pros: Accurately shows the top/bottom ranked restaurants.
** Cons: More expensive operations required to limit ranks of restaurants as a unique ratings list has to be stored to get the limited ranks.
* **Alternative 2:** Let `Limit` denote the number of restaurants to be displayed
** Pros: More intuitive to users.
** Cons: Does not provide an accurate depiction of top/bottom restaurants as multiple restaurants with the same ratings may not be displayed.

// end::selectSortDG[]


=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedFoodDiary`.
It extends `FoodDiary` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `foodDiaryStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedFoodDiary#commit()` -- Saves the current food diary state in its history.
* `VersionedFoodDiary#undo()` -- Restores the previous food diary state from its history.
* `VersionedFoodDiary#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone food diary state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitFoodDiary()`, `Model#undoFoodDiary()` and `Model#redoFoodDiary()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFoodDiary` will be initialized with the initial food diary state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single food diary state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th restaurant in the food diary. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitFoodDiary()`, causing the modified state of the food diary after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `foodDiaryStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted food diary state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new restaurant. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitFoodDiary()`, causing another modified food diary state to be saved into the `foodDiaryStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFoodDiary()`, so the food diary state will not be saved into the `foodDiaryStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the restaurant was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoFoodDiary()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous food diary state, and restores the food diary to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial food diary state, then there are no previous food diary states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoFoodDiary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoFoodDiary()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the food diary to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `foodDiaryStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest food diary state, then there are no undone food diary states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoFoodDiary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the food diary, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitFoodDiary()`, `Model#undoFoodDiary()` or `Model#redoFoodDiary()`. Thus, the `foodDiaryStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitFoodDiary()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `foodDiaryStateList`, all food diary states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire food diary.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the restaurant being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of food diary states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedFoodDiary`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::categorisation[]
=== Restaurant Categorisation

Restaurants can be classified using categories. Each restaurant can have each of the optional categories defined.
Currently, 3 different types of categories are implemented in v1.4: `Cuisine`, `Occasion` and `Price Range`.

==== Current Implementation

Restaurant Categorisation is mainly implemented using the following commands:

* `setCategories` -- sets the different categories of the restaurant using its respective prefixes.
* `filter` -- filters out restaurants using keywords matching that of its categories.

All supported categories are defined in the `seedu.address.model.restaurant.categories` package. A Facade design pattern
is used to allow access to individual `Cuisine`, `Occasion` and `PriceRange` categories through the `Categories` class.

_Figure 1_ below shows the chain of events when setting categories of a restaurant with the setCategories command:

image::SetCategoriesActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 1: setCategories Activity Diagram_

The following elaborates in detail on how the setCategories mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1: User starts keying in the command into the command box. Once prefixes for either `Cuisine`, `Occasion` or `Price Range`
are detected, suggestions for that Category type are retrieved by `CategoriesAutoCompleteTextField` and populated in the appearing
context menu.

Step 2: User finishes typing and submits command for execution. The keyed-in text is sent to the `Food Diary Parser` to be parsed
into a `SetCategoriesCommand` object. The `SetCategoriesCommand` object contains the categories parsed from the text encapsulated
in a `Categories` object as well as the target `Index`.

Step 3: The `SetCategoriesCommand` is executed by calling `SetCategoriesCommand#execute()`. The target restaurant is retrieved
from `Model` via `Model#getFilteredRestaurantList()`. The categories of the target restaurant are merged by calling
`Categories#merge()` and the result is used to create a new restaurant, with all other restaurant data preserved.
The new restaurant is then updated into the Food Diary via `Model#commitFoodDiary()`.

You can refer to _Figure 2_ below to get a better understanding of how a typical valid setCategories command
executes internally.

==== Design Considerations

You can find out more about why certain areas of the feature are implemented a certain way here. Other possible
alternatives are also considered and reasons as to why they were not chosen are also explained here.

===== How a restaurant's Price Range is categorised

This section discusses the different ways price ranges could have been categorised.

* Alternative 1: Use dollar signs to represent price (Current implementation)

|=====================
| Pros | It is easier for the user to type and also visually clearer to the viewer
| Cons | Restricts the range of price between one and five
|=====================

* Alternative 2: Use words such as `cheap`, `expensive` to represent price range

|=========
| Pros | User has complete freedom as to how they want to key in the price range
| Cons | Lacks proper structure, not very intuitive to the viewer if the user keys in something that does not make sense
|=========

I chose Alternative 1 because it offers a better user experience. Users just need to type in a few characters.
It also ensures that all restaurants' price ranges are visually consistent.

===== How categories are added and edited

This section discusses how categories could have been handled.

* Alternative 1: Use one single command to add and edit, only overriding the present categories keyed in (Current implementation)

|=====================
| Pros | User does not need to remember multiple commands to set categories.
| Cons | Users are restricted to the preset types of categories they can set.
|=====================

* Alternative 2: Use separate commands for add and edit

|=====================
| Pros | User can add their own types of categories.
| Cons | User needs to remember which restaurants do not have categories added yet, else add or edit commands might fail.
|=====================

I chose Alternative 1 because there are not many categories a restaurant can have. By having one command to set any category,
users only need to remember one command, hence it is more intuitive for the user.

// tag::reviewcommandsdg[]

=== Add/AddDefault/Edit/Delete Reviews

Reviews are a core feature of the application. Each review is specific to a restaurant, and represents one visit/experience at that particular restaurant. This section describes the implementation of the functions dealing with creating, modifying and modifying reviews. There is also an enhancement in the form of adding default reviews which will be elaborated on.

==== Add Reviews

This command adds a review to a restaurant specified by the `INDEX` argument.

Command format: `addReview INDEX re/(ENTRY) rr/(RATING)`

===== Current Implementation

The functionality of the addReview command can be better understood with the following activity diagram:

image::AddReviewActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

The execution of this command involves:

Step 1. Retrieving the last shown list from the `Model` and retrieving the restaurant indicated by the index from the last shown list.

Step 2. Creating a new list of reviews that copies everything from the original restaurant's list of reviews and inserting the new review into the list and creating a new restaurant object with the new list.

Step 3. Replacing the original restaurant with the new restaurant object in the model.

Refer to the sequence diagram below for an illustration of how this command is executed.

image::AddReviewSequenceDiagram.png[width="750"]

===== Design considerations
Plausible alternative implementations to the functionality are discussed in this section to illustrate the thought process and rationale behind our design decisions. You may wish to consider these ideas when further developing this application.

* Alternative 1: Add reviews directly to the same restaurant object's list rather than creating a new restaurant by object copy
|=====================
| Pros | Less expensive operation to simply modify the same objects list of reviews
| Cons | Requires modification of the `Restaurant` class to include a setter method for reviews and increases the risk of unauthorised modification of restaurant data.
|=====================

==== AddDefault Reviews

This is a command to add pre-defined reviews with a shorter and simpler syntax. It is especially useful for people in a rush and who do not wish to enter the whole review.

Users need only specify the `INDEX` of the restaurant they want to add the review to, and a `NUMBER` representing the default review they wish to leave. For example, "addR 1 2" will add the default review of rating 2 to the 1st restaurant on the list.

Command format: `addR INDEX NUMBER`

===== Current Implementation

The Food Diary currently supports 5 default reviews, each corresponding to a rating from 1-5 inclusive. Do have a look at the User Guide for these 5 entries!

The review `Entry`, which is composed of a String value, will be taken from the `AddDefaultReviewUtil` class. The review `Rating` used is the indicated `NUMBER` in the command. A new `Review` object is created from these two attributes and added.

===== Design Considerations

This alternative was considered as well:

* Alternative 1: Adding a review directly from the new `AddDefaultReviewCommand` instead of creating an `AddReviewCommand`

|=====================
| However, this violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle, as the code to add a review will be repeated.
|=====================

==== Edit Reviews

This command allows the modification of exiting reviews in the Food Diary.

Command format: `editReview INDEX [re/ENTRY] [rr/RATING]`, where `INDEX` refers to the index of the review to edit in the selected restaurant, `ENTRY` and `RATING` are optional, but at least one of the two fields must be specified.

===== Current Implementation

Do refer to the sequence diagram below for a clearer picture of the implementation of this command. Note that the interaction between the `EditReviewCommand` and the `Model` is left out as it is the same as the one in `AddReviewCommand` above.

image::EditReviewSequenceDiagram.png[width="750"]

The components involved in the execution of this command include the `FoodDiaryParser`, the `EditReviewCommandParser` and the `EditReviewCommand` class itself. The main difference from the `AddReviewCommand` is the `EditReviewDescriptor` class, which is used to store the changes for the review.

The `EditReviewDescriptor` class can contain optional fields. This is so that the command does not have to modify every field in a review and users can specify which field they would like to modify.

The steps involved in the execution of this command are:

* Step 1: Creating the `EditReviewDescriptor` based on input arguments.

* Step 2: Retrieving the currently selected restaurant from the model.

* Step 3: Creating a new restaurant based on the currently selected restaurant and the `EditReviewDescriptor`

* Step 4: Replacing the selected restaurant with the new restaurant object in the model.

===== Design Considerations


* Alternative 1: Have users input the index of the restaurant into the command instead of having to select a restaurant first

|=====================
| Considering the technical aspect, there is not much of a difference between the two implementations. However, this design decision took into account the fact that users most likely had to select the restaurant to look at the review they wish to edit before editing it. As such, it reduces the arguments input by the user, and makes use of what is likely going to happen anyways (the selection of the restaurant).
|=====================

// end::reviewcommandsdg[]

==== Delete Reviews

Similar to the command to edit reviews, execution of this command requires the user to select a restaurant from the displayed list.

Command format: `deleteReview INDEX`, where `INDEX` refers to the index of the review to be deleted from the selected restaurant.

The implementation is a combination of the add and edit review commands: the selected restaurant is copied to a new restaurant object with a new list of reviews without the review to be deleted. This new restaurant object then replaces the selected restaurant in the model.


// tag::visitweb[]
=== Visit Webpage Feature

Website can be displayed on the `BrowserPanel` with `visitWeb` command.

==== visitWeb `INDEX`
Visits website of `Restaurant` selected by user.

Restaurants contains a `Weblink` field which encapsulates the Url of the restaurant website.

[NOTE]
When restaurant is added to Food Diary with the `Add` feature, the `Weblink` added with the restaurant is checked by `WebUtil` to ensure that the `Weblink` is a Url that belongs to a website that exists.
If the protocol is absent, `WebUtil` will check if the `Weblink` uses HTTP or HTTPS protocol and append to it. This will be hidden from the user.
If there is no internet connection, `WebUtil` is unable to validate `Weblink` and Food Diary will add the restaurant without the `Weblink`.

Upon `visitWeb INDEX` command, `Weblink` of the Restaurant at the selected index will be retrieved and passed into
`BrowerPanel` of `UI` to load the website of the restaurant as a pop-up window.
Since website of restaurant might be taken down after it has been added to the restaurant, there is a need to validate the `Weblink` again before passing it to `BrowserPanel`.

The following steps illustrates the sequence to `visitWeb INDEX` command with reference to the sequence diagram below:

1. `Weblink` is retrieved from the selectedRestaurant inside `Model` component.
2. Using `WebUtil` utility class in `Commons` component, check if there is internet connection so validate and display the website.
3. If there is no internet connection, inform user.
4. Validate `Weblink` by pinging its Url and checking the HTTP response code.
5. Pass `Weblink` to `BrowserPanel` through `CommandResult` and invoke `WebView` engine to display website.

[NOTE]
HTTP response codes: +
2XX SUCCESS - Weblink is valid +
3XX REDIRECTED - Weblink redirects user to the correct Website and hence is valid +
4XX, 5XX (Error) - Weblink is invalid

The following sequence diagram shows how the visitWeb `index` works:

image::VisitWebSequenceDiagram.png[width="640"]
_Figure 1.1 Sequence diagram of visitWeb `INDEX` command_

==== visitWeb `weblink`
Visits website entered by user.
This allows user to visit website of restaurant that are not added to the Food Diary.

The difference between this command and the previous is that, the `Weblink` is directly passed into `VisitWebCommand` instead of the `INDEX` of the restaurant.
Thus, there is a need to validate this `Weblink` with the help of `WebUtil`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the visitWeb `weblink` works:

image::VisitWebUrlSequenceDiagram.png[width="640"]
_Figure 2.1 Sequence diagram of visitWeb `weblink` command_


To illustrate the level of checks done in visiting web further, the command is broken down into the following steps.

Step 1. Food Lover enters visitWeb `Weblink` command.

Step 2. Food Diary checks if the entered `Weblink` is in the correct Url form. Else, display error message and show example of the correct form of `Weblink`

Step 2. Food Diary checks if internet connection is present. If not, throw `NoInternetException` and show error message.

Step 3. Food Diary validates the weblink entered. If weblink does not exist, or it is not in the correct Url format, throw `ParseException` and show error message.

Step 4. Display website on browser window.

The following activity diagram shows the steps of visitWeb command:

image::VisitWebUrlActivityDiagram.png[width="240"]
_Figure 2.2 Activity diagram of visitWeb `weblink` command_

==== Enhancements
* Before loading the website, the `weblink` will be validated by checking it's HTTP response code.
* If response code is above 400, it suggests that the `weblink` is not found and that there is an error requesting the website if response code is above 500
* Also, a `NoInternetException` is thrown if internet is absent. This is done by pinging to a Google as a reliable web server. If application fails to get a response,
we can say that there is high chance that there is no internet connection and hence `NoInternetException` is thrown.

==== Design considerations
* To reduce coupling of `Weblink` to `AddCommandParser`, `EditCommandParsers` in `Logic`, and also `BrowserPanel` in `UI` component, a `WebUtil` class is implemented under Util of Commons component.

`WebUtil` supports the following functions:

1. `hasInternetConnection()` - Check if there is internet connection by pinging Google.

2. `isUrlValid(String url)` - Checks if the input String is a valid Url with successful response code.

3. `validateAndAppend(String url)` - Checks input Url if it uses HTTP or HTTPS protocol and append it to the Url.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Food Diary depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
