* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.

****
* The filtering is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* If more than one skills are added to the filter, they should be separated by ','
* Filtering does not check if the written condition passes totally. It only checks, if the written condition is contained in the person properties.
e.g if there is someone named Alex, in the filtering conditions `n/ale/n` or `n/le/n` or `n/lex/n`, Alex will be included.
* 'OR' Usage: According to the conditions written, if at least one of them passes with the regarding person in the applicant pool, the person is included in the filtered version.
* 'AND' Usage: According to the conditions written, if every single one of them passes with the regarding person in the applicant pool, the person is included in the filtered version.
* All the people that are included in the filtering will be returned.
* All the operations, that change the content of the address book also clears every single filter.
* After one filtering, the filtered address book can be filtered again.

* Filtering is compatible with all the other commands:
1- clear : since the persons list changes, the filtering is automatically cleared
2- add : when filtering is active, adding is not allowed. To add someone, filtering should be cleared.
3- sort / select / delete / edit / list / undo / redo / help / exit / history : can be used without clearing the filter
