== What Is This?

This is a simple restaurant management application intended to ease the management of front-end operations in restaurants.
This is a desktop application that has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
Hence, our target users are restaurant waiters and managers who can type fast and prefer typing over clicking on GUI.

== What Can It Do?

It can...

* Display the current status of the restaurant at any time.
* Manage the use of tables in the restaurant.
* Track all orders for all tables in the restaurant.
* Update the availability of items on the restaurant's menu.
* Consolidate statistics of the restaurant.
** Total revenue
** Total number of customers
** Order frequency of menu items
