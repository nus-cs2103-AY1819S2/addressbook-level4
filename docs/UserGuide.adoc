== Introducing HMS+

You need a world-class property management system to run your hotel’s front desk and back office. We’ve spent years listening to what independent hoteliers need to take their business to the next level. From before check-in to post check out, we have everything you need to get your customers moving and your hotel running.

HMS+ is for hotels that want to use a *single, integrated system to manage all aspects of their requirements*.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the HMS+ installation process, system configuration and management, monitoring and troubleshooting problems. In addition, the <<Getting Started>> will provide the basic knowledge of the setup process and how you can get started.

== Getting Started

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `hms+.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Hotel Management System Plus.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The application should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list-customers`* : lists all customers
* **`add-customer`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com id/887 a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a customer named `John Doe` to the HMS+ database.
* **`delete-customer`**`3` : deletes the 3rd customer  shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items in curly brackets separated by a slash (`/`) are interchangeable (entering either of those items have the same effect) e.g. `{addcustomer/ac}` are two aliases of the same command.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
