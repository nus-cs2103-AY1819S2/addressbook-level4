This page aims to showcase my contributions to the project
*In-Credit-Ble* under module _CS2103T_. I will be giving you an introduction to *In-Credit-Ble*,
followed by summarising my contributions. Lastly, I will be showing you the relevant sections of User Guide (UG) and
Development Guide (DG) that I documented.  I hope that after reading through this page, you will have a better
understanding of my contributions to this project. +

This project was developed with the following utilities:

== PROJECT: In-Credit-Ble (Finance Tracker)

---

== Overview

_In-Credit-Ble_ is a desktop Finance Tracker that is tailored to help users manage their finances
and keep track of their budget in an *easy and efficient* manner. It is designed for those who
prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), especially for those who prefer to type over
using their mouse.

 As part of the module requirement, my team and I (of 5 students from NUS)
 had to morph an existing application and develop a functional product in a short
 span of 13 weeks while learning new software engineering concepts. We have chosen to
 morph the existing application from an Address Book to a Finance Tracker.
 In the following sections, I will be summarising my contributions to this project through the major
 and minor features implemented for _In-Credit-Ble_.

== Summary of Contributions
|===
|This section will give you a brief overview of my contributions to the project. +

This section will be split into *Major Enhancement*, *Minor Enhancements* and *Notable Contributions* sub-sections.

=== Features Contributed to Project

==== Major enhancement: added `CategoryBudget`
** *_What it does_*: Allows user to set a budget for categories so as to keep track
of the expenses for each category (such as `Food`, `Travel`, `Clothes`).

** *_Justification_*: This feature improves the product significantly and enhances user
ability to manage their expenses according to categories. It allows users to categorise
their spending to know which area he/she should
start spending less. It also requires
integration of the `Logic`, `Model` and `UI` components of the project.

** *_Highlights of feature:_*
*** This enhancement can be triggered using the `allocate` command. Each of the category
budget is stored in the `TotalBudget` class which is implemented in the `Model` component.

*** Each category budget can be shown to the user in the Result Display when the user executes the `show`
command. It shows the current spending over the the total budget allocated for each individual category.


==== Minor enhancement: Changing theme of application
** *_What it does_:* Allows user to change the colour theme of the application to pre-set themes
such as `Dark`, `Light`, `Blue`, `Pink`.
** *_Justification_:* This feature allows the user to have minor customisation of their In-Credit-Ble
Finance Tracker Application
** *_Highlights of feature:_*
*** This feature can be triggered using the `theme` command. Triggering this command will result in
the `UI` component changing its stylesheet to fit the pre-set themes indicated by the user.

=== Other Contributions
==== Notable Contributions
** *Project Management*
*** *Manging Issue Tracker*
**** Added the necessary issue type labels as specified by course requirement. +
(e.g. `type.Story`, `type.Enhancement`, `status.onGoing`, `status.Completed`, `priorityHigh`)

== Contributions to the User Guide
|===
|The next section will include my contribution to the User Guide. It showcases my ability
in documenting a reader-friendly User Guide that is designed for the new users of _In-Credit-Ble_.
It is important to be able to write a user-friendly guide that will allow new users to quickly grasp
how to use our application. +
|===

=== Quick Start and Graphical User Interface
[NOTE]
====
To allow users to get started with our application with ease, I've created the `Quick Start` and
`Graphical User Interface Introduction` (GUI) sections. This section shows how I am able to use diagrams
to support my writing so that users can have visual aids to guide their understanding. +

Due to page limit constraints, I will only be listing the major portion of my contribution.

=== `Allocate`, `Show` and `Theme` Commands
[NOTE]
====
The following sections extracted from the User Guide are the instructions to users on how to use the features that I have
implemented for this project. It includes the `allocate`, `show` and `theme` commands.
These three sections show my ability to describe the feature in simple terms that new users are able to comprehend.
In addition, examples on how to use the commands are also included so that the users are able to
follow in a sequential manner. +

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
|===
|The following section will include the sections of my contribution to the Developer Guide.
It showcases my ability to write technical documentation and illustrates the technical depth of my code contributions.
This is important in real-world software engineering projects where we are expected to work in teams. Being able to
document the Developer Guide well will allow colleagues or other developers to understand our implementation better. +
