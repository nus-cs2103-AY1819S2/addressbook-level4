// tag::evan-intro[]
== Introduction
BrainTrain is a *spaced-repetition card application* which makes *memorizing easy and effective*. With BrainTrain's link:https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/23/spaced-repetition-a-hack-to-make-your-brain-store-information[Spaced Repetition System (SRS)] optimizing your card revision intervals, you will be able to *learn more in less time*.

*Who is it for:*

- Anyone who needs to memorise anything (e.g. Japanese vocabulary, the periodic table, the human anatomy). BrainTrain's card system is *content-agnostic* and *flexible*. It accommodates all forms of learning you may require.
- Anyone who needs to create flashcards for educational purposes. BrainTrain's cards are grouped as lessons which can be *easily imported and exported*. These lessons are also saved in `.csv` files which you *can edit in your favourite spreadsheet application* (e.g. Excel).

*Main features of BrainTrain:*

- You can manage card lessons in BrainTrain's management mode or alternatively do so in your preferred spreadsheet application.
- You can attempt card lessons in BrainTrain's quiz mode which will track and manage your user-specific spaced-repetition data automatically.

[[Features]]
== Features

// tag::evan-format[]
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameter values which you need to specify in order for the commands to work. For example,
for `deleteCard INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter you have to specify.
* Parameters in `[ ]` brackets are optional. For example, for the `addCard t/TEST t/TEST [t/TEST]... [h/HINT]...` command, you have to specify at least *2* `TEST` values, but you can optionally specify more than *2* `TEST` values. You can also specify *0 or more* `OPTIONAL` values.
* Parameters with trailing `...` can be specified more than once. For example, for the `addLesson n/NAME t/TEST t/TEST [t/TEST]... [h/HINT]...` command, you can specify *0 or more* `HINT` values and *2 or more* `TEST` values. On the other hand, you can only specify exactly *1* `NAME` value.
* Parameters can be entered in any order. For example, for the `addCard t/TEST t/TEST [t/TEST]... [h/HINT]...` command, you can use the
command as such: `addCard t/Australia h/Starts with C t/Canberra t/English`.

=== Management mode

[[help]]
==== Viewing help: `help`

Displays usage information on all commands. +
Format: `help`

[TIP]
Alternatively, press kbd:[F1] to display usage information on all commands.

==== Changing theme: `changeTheme`

Changes the theme from light to dark vice versa. +
Format: `changeTheme`

// tag::lei[]
[[start]]
==== Starting a quiz session: `start`

Starts a new quiz session. +
Format: `start LESSON_INDEX [c/COUNT] m/MODE`

[NOTE]
====
This command only works in lesson view. If you are currently editing a lesson in card view, you have to use the <<quit, `quit`>> command to return to lesson view before you can use this command.
====

Usage rules:

* You must specify the index of lesson to be started. If your input index is out of range of current Lesson List, an error will be thrown.
* You can optionally specify the `COUNT` parameter. `COUNT` sets the number of cards to be tested in the quiz session.
** If no `COUNT` is specified, by default 1 card is tested.
** If `COUNT` is larger than the size of the current lesson, the `COUNT` will be reset to be the size of the lesson by default.
* You must specify index and count as a valid number which should be less than the MAXIMUM_INTEGER(0*7ffffffff), otherwise an error will be thrown.
* You must specify `MODE`. `MODE` sets the testing mode of the quiz session. The four available modes are `LEARN`, `PREVIEW`, `REVIEW` and `DIFFICULT`.
. `LEARN`: Displays new cards with both question and answer before test begins, and then only question is shown to test you. If you have already learned all the cards in current lesson, an error of no more new card to learn will be thrown.
. `PREVIEW`: Displays both question and answer of cards. You will not be tested.
. `REVIEW`: Tests the words based on the spaced-repetition algorithm, which means that cards with the earliest test date are tested first. If no card has due date before current time, an error of no card for review will be thrown.
. `DIFFICULT`: Displays cards you previously labelled as difficult with both question and answer shown. You will not be tested. If no card has been labelled as difficult, an error of no difficult card will be thrown.

[NOTE]
====
Only in review mode, cards are tested based on the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Space-Repetition system].
====

Examples:

* `start 1 m/LEARN` +
Starts a quiz in `LEARN` mode. Cards will be chosen from the first lesson in lesson list. Since count is not specified, the quiz will only contain one card by default.
* `start 2 c/20 m/PREVIEW` +
Starts a quiz containing 20 cards chosen from the second lesson in lesson list in `PREVIEW` mode, which only displays question and answer together one time.

[NOTE]
====
After you start a quiz session with the `start` command, BrainTrain will switch to <<quizmode, `quiz
mode`>> and you will only be allowed to enter <<quizmode, `quiz mode`>> commands.
====

* You must specify at least 2 `TEST` values. Flashcards added to this lesson must have corresponding `TEST` values.
** For example, a lesson for memorising _muscle anatomy_ will have three `TEST` values: 'Muscle', 'Action' and 'Innervation'.
** By default, the first 2 `TEST` values ('Muscle' and 'Action') will be tested when the lesson is started in quiz mode.
** You can set the 2 `TEST` values to be tested by using the <<set, `set`>> command.
* You can specify 0 or more `HINT` values (e.g. 'Muscle Group').
** `HINT` values are displayed during quiz mode when you enter <<hint, `\hint`>>.

Examples:

* `addLesson n/Capitals of the world t/Country t/Capital t/Language h/Hint`
** Adds a lesson named 'Capitals of the world' with 3 `TEST` values and 1 `HINT` value.
* `addLesson n/Chinese vocabulary t/English t/Chinese`
** Adds a lesson named 'Chinese vocabulary' with 2 `TEST` values.

==== Deleting a lesson: `deleteLesson` +

[[quizmode]]
=== Quiz mode +
When you <<start, `start`>> a quiz, you will enter quiz mode. In this mode, you will only be allowed to enter the following set of quiz commands. Management commands are disabled in this mode.

==== Answering a card : `[ANSWER]` +
An input without the `\` prefix will be treated as an answer to the current card. +
Format: `[ANSWER]...`

****
Usage rules:

* You can answer with one or more words (e.g. "Tokyo" or "Aland Islands").

What a card contains:

* For each card, total attempts and answer streak are tracked.
* Total attempts refers to the number of times you have attempted this card, regardless of
whether you were answered it correctly.
* The answer streak is the number of times you have answered the card correctly consecutively.
****

[NOTE]
The streak will be reduced to 0 after you answer a card wrongly twice in a row. Hence, if you
accidentally enter the wrong answer once, your streak for the question will not be affected, unless you answer wrongly again.

[TIP]
You can press kbd:[ENTER] twice without entering any other input to reveal the answer.

[[usermode]]
=== User Transfer mode

You can use BrainTrain across different devices. This is an in-built feature that is automated in BrainTrain.

==== Using BrainTrain across different devices

To transfer your files: +

. Store the `userdata` and `lessons` folder into your transfer device (thumbdrive etc.).
. On another device, ensure that BrainTrain has been executed `at least once`.
. Transfer and overwrite the `userdata` and `lessons` folder.
. Your progress will be automatically imported on that device.

{empty} +

== Future enhancements

=== Importing data from website [Coming in v2.0]

Easily transfer files using import command to get files directly from a specific link without the use of transfer devices. +
The usage of hard drives to transfer and pull documents has reduced overtime as new cloud storage are introduced. Thus, with this new feature, it will help to pull the user file and lessons from links. +
Example : `import User l/[INSERT_DESIRED_LINK_HERE]`

// end::jeraldtsy[]

=== Supporting timer countdown in quiz mode [Coming in v2.0]

User will see a 10 seconds timer countdown when answering a question (e.g. learn or review mode).

=== Supporting auto generation of mcq in quiz mode [Coming in v2.0]

BrainTrain will auto generate a list of mcq options depending on the list of values in the
user specified lesson.

=== Support other spreadsheet formats such as .xlsx [Coming in v2.0]
BrainTrain will be able to accept more robust spreadsheet file formats.

// tag::lei[]
=== Supporting starting a quiz session with multiple lessons [Coming in v2.0]

* Format: `start LESSON_INDEX_1 LESSON_INDEX_2 [c/COUNT1] [c/COUNT2] m/MODE`
* You can start a quiz session with cards from more than one lesson. The sequence of cards will be random instead of following the sequence of lessons to increase the difficulty for you to memorize.
* Example: `start 1 2 c/5 c/5 m/learn`
** Starts a quiz with 5 words from the first lesson and 5 words from the second lesson in `LEARN` mode.
// end::lei[]

{empty} +

// tag::eugene_troubleshoot[]

== Troubleshooting

*Q*: Why are my card values shown as `?????`? +
*A*: If your lesson contains non-English characters such as:

* Characters with accents: `à`
* Non-English words : `こんにちは` `السلام عليكم` `你好`

This can be fixed by opening the lesson file in your preferred spreadsheet application (e.g. Excel), and then saving it as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)`. UTF encoding allows a computer to show non-English characters. +
****
The default encoding setting is unable to process special characters. As a result, you will need to save it as a `UTF-8` encoded file.

Note that externally created lesson files have to be saved with UTF-8 encoding before using them in BrainTrain. +
If the files are saved without `UTF-8` encoding, any non-English data may be saved as `?????`, and the data will be lost.
****

{empty} +

*Q*: Why are my lessons not loading? +
*A*: Please verify if the location of BrainTrain is suitable. Depending on your computer's permissions and security settings, places such as the Desktop may not be usable, and your operating system may prevent BrainTrain from loading the lesson files.

If BrainTrain still does not load lessons despite trying other locations, please contact Team BrainTrain at https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-1/main/issues[our issue tracker] or email us at eugenef@u.nus.edu, and attach any generated braintrain.log files.

{empty} +

// end::eugene_troubleshoot[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and transfer the lesson `.csv` files over to the `lessons` directory, and userdata `.csv` files over to the `userdata` directory.
