== Summary of contributions

Personal code contributions available at https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=jkhiani[reposense]

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to favorite/unfavorite persons*
** What it does: allows the user to add people to their favorites list, view their favorites list, and remove people from favorites list.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user no longer needs to sift through their addressbook (as it can get very large) to organize a few select people they are working with at the moment.
** Highlights: Being able to manipulate the storage for favorites was a challenge, along with figuring out how to provide suggestions if names weren't fully typed out (first + last)

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to click on a person card and view their address on a Google Map.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to view the total number of clients and companies in the addressbook displayed in the status footer.

* *Minor enhancement*: set tags to be highlighted different colors.
** Credits: Heavily relied on demo code from pull request https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[#798]
