By: `W14-2`      Since: `Feb 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFX plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialogue first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all the resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test directory as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

// tag::Architecture[]
== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="763", height="339"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] directory. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Model, *`Model`*>>: Holds the data of images in the App in memory.


Each of the first three components does the following:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.


The `Model` component consists of three components:

*  `Album` which stores the pool of images that has been imported into the App.
*  `CurrentEdit` which holds the image that the App is currently editing in-memory.
*  `TransformationSet` which stores the preset commands created by the user to edit the image.

// end::Architecture[]

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]

==== How the Architecture Components Interact with Each Other
// tag::ArchiInteraction[]

The _Sequence Diagrams_ below show how the components interact with each other for the scenarios where the user keys in the commands `import C:\Users\XXX\Desktop\Pictures` and `rotate 90`.

.Component interactions for `import C:\Users\XXX\Desktop\Pictures` command
image::SDforImportcommand.png[width="800"]

.Component interactions for `rotate 90` command
image::SDforRotatecommand.png[width="800"]

// end::ArchiInteraction[]
The sections below give more details of each component.


[[Design-Ui]]
// tag::ui[]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]
The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of the following
components:

 * `CommandBox`
 * `ResultDisplay`
 * `ImagePanel`
 * `InitPanel`
 * `InformationPanel`
 * `StatusBarFooter`
 * `HelpWindow`

All components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `InformationPanel` comprises of three tabs:

. Album Images
- Displays all images currently opened in the `assets` directory and available for editing.
. EXIF Profile
- Displays all ancillary tags attached to the currently opened
image such as metadata information like *Date and Time* and *Copyright information*.
. Command History
- Display all *Image Transformation* and *Image Filters* applied to the currently opened image.

The `UI` component is supplemented by a `Notifier` class. The class implements Java's `propertyChangeListener` as a means of drawing updates to the User Interface.

For example, the `ImageView` component draws updates to an opened image in the following sequence:

. Register the `ImageView` component with the `Notifier` class.
. `Notifier` is called when `Open` command is executed with a given Property Name.
. `Notifier` fires an alert with the Property Name to all registered listener.
. `ImageView` checks if the Property Name is pertaining to it and redraws the image shown by accessing `Album`.

[NOTE]
The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` directory.
// end::ui[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FomoFotoParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `CurrentEdit` (e.g. rotating an image) and `Album` (e.g. saving an image).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

// tag::LogicComponentSequenceDiagrams[]
Given below are the Sequence Diagrams for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("import C:\User\Pictures\image.png")` and `execute("rotate 90")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `import C:\User\Pictures\image.png` Command

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `rotate 90` Command
image::LogicRotateSd.png[width="800"]
// end::LogicComponentSequenceDiagrams[]

// tag::DesignModel[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponents.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/CurrentEdit.java[`CurrentEdit.java`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Album.java[`Album.java`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Album.java[`Image.java`]

The Model component comprises of three main classes, `CurrentEdit`, `TransformationSet` and `Album`.

The core functions of the `CurrentEdit` Class are listed below:

* stores an `Image` instance in `tempImage` and `originalImage` when an image is opened.
* creates a copy of the opened image and the currently edited image in `temp` directory.
* `tempImage` is updated each time a command to edit the image is called. (e.g. `RotateCommand`, `ContrastCommand`)
* stores a list of commands that the user input after an image is opened.
* contains methods to access `temp` directory.
// end::DesignModel[]

The `TransformationSet` class is implemented using the Singleton pattern. This design choice was made to ensure that only a single instance of `TransformationSet` is used in FomoFoto at runtime. This design also eliminates redundant passing of instance variables of `TransformationSet` across all logic and model components.

The core functions of the `Transformation` class are listed below:

* Stores a reference to all the preset commands saved by the user as a HashMap that contains a `String` as a key and a `List<Command>`as a value.
* Contains various helper methods to access the HashMap that stores the preset commands.

//tag::albumModel[]
The `Album` class is also implemented using the Singleton pattern. This design choice was purposely made as only a single instance of `Album` should reside in FomoFoto at any one time. This design also reduces the need for passing instance variables across all logic and model components.

The core functions of the `Album` class are listed below:

* Stores a reference to all imported images as List.
* Contains various helper methods to access the `assets` directory, the storage for the raw image files.
* Fires property changes to listeners attached to the `Notifier` to redraw UI elements.

The Model also comprises of a smaller subclass, `Image`.

The `Image` class encapsulates the fields of a raw image file. This design choice allows for better abstraction between classes and easy reuse between commands.

The core functions of the `Image` class are listed below.

* Validation checks to see if a raw image is a valid Image.
* Keeps a command history of edits executed on this Image.
//end::albumModel[]

////
[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]
////


// tag::StorageComponent[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageArchitectureDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `assets` and `temp` directories form the storage component of FomoFoto.

*  The `assets` directory stores images that the user imported
* The `temp` directory stores the image that the program is currently editing on.
* The `Album` class contains methods to save and retrieve images from the `assets` directory.
* The `CurrentEdit` class contains methods to overwrite and retrieve the image that the program is currently editing on.
// end::StorageComponent[]

//tag::DetailsStorage[]
The `assets` and `temp` directory from the storage component of FomoFoto. Both directories are created during runtime of the application.

The `assets` directory is created in the same directory where FomoFoto is first launched and persist between sessions. The `assets` directory is marked as `FomoFoto.assets`.

The `temp` directory is created per FomoFoto session. The target directory for the `Temporary File` directory is in both Windows and OS X. The `temp` directory is removed on program exit.

[NOTE]
If FomoFoto is not given the permissions to write `assets` and `temp` to their respective directories i.e. limited write permissions, the application might not function properly.
//end::DetailsStorage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::Export[]
=== Export Feature

The `export` command exports a file in the album into a specified directory.

==== Current Implementation
The export function is facilitated by `Album`. It uses the following operations:

* `Album#getImageFromList(String)` - returns an image from the album with name matching the input string and null if no image matches the input string.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `export` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `export f/iu.jpg d/C:\Users\randy\Desktop`.

Step 2. `ExportCommandParser` checks if the user has input the command correctly.

Step 3. `Album#getImageFromList` checks if the file to be exported exists in the album and throws a `CommandException` if it does not exist.

Step 4. `ExportCommand#validPath` checks if the specified directory is valid and throws a `CommandException` if it is not.

Step 5. If the file to be exported exists and directory is valid, the file will be copied to the directory.


The following sequence diagram shows how the `export` command works:

.Sequence Diagram for Export Command
image::ExportSequenceDiagram.png[width=600]

// end::Export[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import feature
The Import Command allows users to import a file of an image format into FomoFoto for editing.

==== Current implementation
The implementation of the import feature allows for users to either:

 * Import a single image file.
 * Import all image files in a directory.
 * Import a sample list of image files.

Image file must adhere to a subset of the following formats as describe by its MIME type standardized in IETF's RFC 6838:

* `.bmp`
* `.jpeg` or `.jpg`
* `.png`
* `.tif` or `.tiff`
* `.gif`

[NOTE]
Images with `.tif` or `.tiff` formats are not rendered on screen due to a limitation with JavaFX but edits made will still be applied.

Images must also adhere to the following additional requirements:

. Not be hidden or prepended by a `.` dot identifier.
. Not be over 10MB in size.
. Not have the same name as an existing image in the Album.

[NOTE]
Implementation of these checks can be found in `ImportCommandParser`.

Images found in the given arguments will be copied to an `assets` directory created at runtime in FomoFoto's home directory. This is facilitated by the `Album` class and `ImportCommandParser` and contains the following operation:

 * `Album#refreshAlbum()` - Fires a property change to all registered listeners. Listeners addressing this particular property will trigger and update accordingly.
 * `ImportCommandParser#parse(String)` - Takes in an absolute path, perform sanity checks on availability, size, format and copies the image to `assets` directory.

Additionally, the `import sample` command is supported by the `ResourceWalker` class. This class traverses through a sample directory of valid image files and populates FomoFoto.

Example usage scenario:

 1. The user launches the application and enters `import C:\Users\Addison\Desktop\sample.png`
 2. `ImportCommandParser` takes in arguments and performs validation on a given path. Image is copied to `assets` directory and added to Album if it is valid.
 3. `Album` display the imported image to UI by calling the `Notifier` class which calls on the display panel listening to the notifier.
 4. `InformationPanel` updates to reflect the imported image in the Album.

.Sequence Diagram for Import Command
image::ImportSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1*: Import single images only.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Importing multiple images from the same directory needs repeated commands.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice)*: Import images from a directory as well.
** Pros: Can import many images without repeating the command.
** Cons: Can result in errors if too many images are imported or images are of alternative formats.
// end::import[]


=== Open Feature
// tag::DGOpen[]
This command allows the user to open a previously imported image for editing.

==== Current Implementation
The `open` function is facilitated by `Album` and `CurrentEdit`. It uses the following operations:

* `Album#checkFileExist(String)` - Checks if file name specified by the `String` exists in assets directory.

* `Album#retrieveImage(String)` - Returns an `Image` specified by the `String` in assets directory.

* `CurrentEdit#openImage(Image)` - Creates two copies of the opened image in `temp` directory. The duplicated images are instantiated as `tempImage` and `originalImage`.

* `CurrentEdit#updateExif()` - Updates the Exif data of the image.

* `CurrentEdit#displayTempImage()` - Displays the temporary image stored in the `temp` directory.



.Sequence Diagram for Open Command +
image::OpenCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

The following is an example usage scenario of how `open` behaves at each step as shown in the figure above.

Step 1. The user executes `open sample.png`.

Step 2. `Album#checkFileExist(String)` is called to check if the file specified by the `String` is in `assets` directory. If it exists, `Album#retrieveImage(String)` is called to create an `Image` object from the specified file. Otherwise, `CommandException` is thrown.

Step 3. The `Image` is passed to `CurrentEdit#openImage(Image)` to create two copies of it, named `temp_img.png` and `ori_img.png`, in `temp` directory. These copies are then instantiated as `tempImage` and `originalImage`.

Step 4. `CurrentEdit#updateExif()` is called to update the information of the opened image.

Step 5. `CurrentEdit#displayTempImage()` is called to display the opened image on the GUI.




==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: The user can only open and edit one image at a time.
** Advantages:
*** Easy to implement.
*** Saves space as `temp` directory only stores one original image and one temporary image.
*** Clear to users that edits are done to the only opened image.
** Disadvantage: Only one image can be edited at a time.

* *Alternative 2*: The user can open and edit multiple images.
** Advantage: Images can be edited simultaneously.
** Disadvantages:
*** Hard to distinguish whether the user is opening an image from `assets` or `temp` directory.
*** Requires many duplicates with different temporary names.
*** May be confusing for the user.

Alternative 1 was chosen as it is less complicated, requires lesser space and more user-friendly.
// end::DGOpen[]

=== List Files Feature

// tag::DGListFiles[]

This command displays the names of all the files in the `assets` directory.

==== Current Implementation
The `listfiles` function is facilitated by `Album`. It uses the following operation:

* `Album#getFileNames()` - Returns a list of all the files in `assets` directory.


[[sequencediagram_listfiles]]
.Sequence Diagram for ListFiles +
image::ListFilesCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

The following is an example usage scenario of how `listfiles` behaves at each step as shown in the figure above.

Step 1. The user executes `listfiles`.

Step 2. `Album#getFileNames()` accesses `assets` directory and returns all the file names in a `String` array.

Step 3. The `String` array is displayed on the GUI.


==== Design Considerations

This command was created to allow the user to know what files are stored in `assets` directory so that the `FILENAME` can be easily referenced for `open`.

// end::DGListFiles[]

// tag::ImageFilter[]
=== Image Filters
==== Current Implementation

The filter mechanism is facilitated by https://github.com/sksamuel/scrimage[`scrimage`], an external API Library that provides image filters methods for our image editor. The gradle script declares a compile-time dependency on this external API through the coordinates:  `group: 'com.sksamuel.scrimage'`, `name: 'scrimage-filters_2.12'`, `version: '3.0.0-alpha4'`.

The image filters feature is facilitated by `CurrentEdit`. It uses the following operations:

* `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist()` - Returns `true` if `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit` is null. `tempImage` is null only if `open` command is never called.

* `CurrentEdit#getTempImage` - Retrieves the temporary image `tempImage` which stores the filepath of the temporary image, its history of edits [`List<Command>`] and its metadata.

* `CurrentEdit#updateTempImage` - Replaces the temporary image in the `temp` directory with the newly edited image and updates the `tempImage` instance in the class.

* `CurrentEdit#addCommand` - Adds this command to the edit history [`List<Command>`] in `tempImage` for the `undo/redo` command.

* `CurrentEdit#displayTempImage()` - Displays the temporary image stored in the `temp` directory.

The filter feature mainly consists of:

* `ContrastCommand`: Applies a `double` contrast ratio value on the opened image. The `double` contrast ratio value is preset to 1.1 if a specified `double` ratio value is not given by the user.  A value above 1 (e.g 1.3) increases the contrast of the image while a positive value below 1 (e.g 0.5) reduces the contrast of the image.
* `BrightnessCommand`: Applies a `double` brightness ratio value on the opened image. The `double` brightness ratio value is preset to 1.1 if a specified `double` ratio value is not given by the user. A value above 1 (e.g 1.3) increases the brightness of the image while a positive value below 1 (e.g 0.5) reduces the brightness of the image.
* `BlackWhiteCommand`: Transforms the opened image to a black and white image given a threshold value. The threshold `integer` value is preset to 127 if a specified threshold is not given by the user. Pixels on the image lighter than the threshold value will become white and pixels darker than the threshold value will become black.

The following describes the main operations and processes for each command stated above.

==== Contrast Command

This command calls for an adjustment of contrast on an opened image. After adjusting the contrast, it adds this specific command called by the user to the `List<Commands>` belonging to the `tempImage` found in `CurrentEdit` which saves the editing history of the opened image.

[[sequencediagram_contrast]]
.Sequence Diagram for Contrast Command
image::ContrastCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how `contrast` behaves at each step as shown in <<sequencediagram_contrast>>. [This applies to the other image filter commands as well.]

Step 1. When the user runs an `open` command to edit an image, it invokes a method which creates an instance of an `Image` that stores the file path of the image, its history of edits [`List<Command>`] and its metadata. This `Image` object is saved under the variable name `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit` for editing.

Step 2. When the user enters the command (e.g. `contrast 0.3`), the entered command is parsed and the command will be executed.

[NOTE]
If an invalid command is provided, a reminder of how to use the command will be given to the user and no command will be executed.

Step 3. During execution, the `execute` method in the `ContrastCommand` class first invokes `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist` to check if an image is opened. If no image is opened, it will throw an error message to inform the user to open an image for editing first. Else, the `execute` method will invoke `CurrentEdit#getTempImage()` to get the `tempImage` from `CurrentEdit`.

Step 4. Upon retrieving the `tempImage`, the `execute` method creates a `ContrastFilter` instance provided by the external library [`scrimage`] which takes in a `double` contrast ratio value. This `ContrastFilter` will then be applied to the image retrieved from the file path of `tempImage`.

Step 5. After applying the `ContrastFilter` on the opened image, `CurrentEdit#updateTempImage()` is invoked to save the newly edited image and replace the previous one in the file path of the `tempImage`.

Step 6. The `execute` method then checks if the boolean `isNewCommand` is true. If it is `true`, it indicates that the command is a new contrast command called directly from the user and not through an `undo/redo` command. This triggers Step 7 in the line below. Otherwise, the command's execution ends in this step.

Step 7. `isNewCommand` is set to `false` to signal that this command is not a new contrast command if it is executed again through the `undo/redo` command.

Step 8. `CurrentEdit#addCommand(this)` is invoked to add this command to the `List<Command>` in `tempImage` for the undo/redo function and `CurrentEdit#displayTempImage()` is used to display the edited image on the graphical user interface.

===== Design Considerations

 * Intermediate images that are still being edited have to be stored in a temporary folder first due to our `undo/redo` implementation.

==== Brightness Command
This command calls for an adjustment of brightness on an opened image. After adjusting the brightness, it adds this specific command called by the user to the `List<Commands>` belonging to the `tempImage` found in `currentEdit` which saves the editing history of the opened image.

Refer to the example usage scenario, sequence diagram and design considerations in <<Contrast Command>>.

==== BlackWhite Command
This command calls for a transformation of an opened image to a black and white image. After applying the black and white filter, it adds this specific command called by the user to the `List<Commands>` belonging to the `tempImage` found in `currentEdit` which saves the editing history of the opened image.

Refer to the example usage scenario, sequence diagram and design considerations in <<Contrast Command>>.
// end::ImageFilter[]


=== Image Manipulation
// tag::ImageManipulation[]
==== Current Implementation

This segment involves manipulating the physical image itself, such as rotating, cropping and resizing. The implementations of these features are facilitated by https://github.com/rkalla/imgscalr[`ImgScalr Library`], which is an external API Library that helps process the target image.

The manipulation feature is facilitated by `CurrentEdit`. It uses the following operations:

 * `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist()` - Returns `true` if `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit` is null. `tempImage` is null only if `open` command is never called.

 * `CurrentEdit#getTempImage` - Retrieves the temporary image `tempImage` which stores the filepath of the temporary image, its history of edits [`List<Command>`] and its metadata.

 * `CurrentEdit#updateTempImage` - Replaces the temporary image in `temp` directory with the newly edited image and updates the `tempImage` instance in the class.

 * `CurrentEdit#addCommand` - Adds this command to the edit history `List<Command>` in `tempImage` for the `undo/redo` command.

 * `CurrentEdit#displayTempImage()` - Displays the temporary image stored in the `temp` directory.

This manipulation feature mainly consists of:

* `RotateCommand`: Allows users to rotate images by specifying a degree (90, 180 or 270 only).
* `CropCommand`: Allows users to crop images by specifying the coordinates of the top left corner, the width and the height of the desired cropped image.
* `ResizeCommand`: Allows users to resize images to the desired width and height.

The following describes the main operations and processes for each command stated above.

==== Rotate Command
This command allows the user to rotate the targeted image by specifying a degree (90, 180 or 270 only). Upon receiving an input degree from the user, the degree will be checked for its validity and will throw an error if the degree is not within the specified range. The command will then be added to the `List<Commands>` belonging to `tempImage` found in `currentEdit` which saves the editing history of the targeted image.

The diagram below illustrates how the `Rotate` Command works:

.Sequence Diagram for Rotate Command
image::RotateCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command should behave at each step. (This applies to the other image manipulation commands as well.):

Step 1. When the user runs an open command to edit an image, it invokes a method which creates an instance of an `Image` that stores the file path of the image, its history of edits `List<Command>` and its metadata. This `Image` object is saved under the variable name `tempImage` in `currentEdit` for editing.

Step 2. When the user enters the command (e.g. `rotate 90`), the entered command is parsed and the command will be executed.

[NOTE]
If an invalid command is provided, a reminder of how to use the command will be given to the user and no command will be executed.

Step 3. During execution, the `execute` method in the `RotateCommand` class first invokes `currentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist` to check if an image is opened. If no image is opened, it will throw an error message to inform the user to open an image for editing. Else, the `execute` method will invoke `currentEdit#getTempImage()` to get the `tempImage` from `CurrentEdit`.

Step 4. Upon retrieving the `tempImage`, the `execute` method in `RotateCommand` gets a `BufferedImage` instance from `tempImage`.The method then calls the external library https://github.com/rkalla/imgscalr[`ImgScalr`]'s class `rotate` and passes the `BufferedImage` object in.

Step 5. A `BufferedImage` object is returned from the external library and `currentEdit#updateTempImage()` is invoked to save the newly edited `BufferedImage` and replace the previous image in the file path of the `tempImage`.

Step 6. The `execute` method then checks if the boolean `isNewCommand` is true. If it is true, it indicates that the command is a new `Rotate` command called directly from the user and not through an `undo/redo` command which triggers Step 7 in the line below. Otherwise, the command’s execution ends in this step.

Step 7. `isNewCommand` is set to false to signal that this command is not a new rotate command if it is executed again through the `undo/redo` command. `currentEdit#addCommand(this)` is invoked to add this command to the `List<Command>` in `tempImage` for the `undo/redo` function and `currentEdit#displayTempImage()` is used to display the edited image on the graphical user interface. +

===== Design Considerations

* Images that are still being edited have to be stored and edited in a temporary directory first due to our `undo/redo` implementation.

// end::ImageManipulation[]
==== Crop Command
This command allows the user to crop the targeted image by specifying the coordinates of the top left-hand corner of the desired image, the width of the desired image and the height of the desired image. Upon receiving the inputs, the values will be checked for their validity and will throw an error if any value is not within the specified range. The command will then be added to the `List<Command>` belonging to `tempImage` found in `currentEdit` which saves the editing history of the targeted image.

Refer to the example usage scenario, sequence diagram and design considerations in <<Rotate Command>>.

==== Resize Command
This command allows the user to resize the targeted image by specifying the width and height of the desired image. Upon receiving the inputs, the values will be checked for their validity and will throw an error if any value is not within the specified range. The command will then be added to the `List<Command>` belonging to `tempImage` found in `currentEdit` which saves the editing history of the targeted image.

Refer to the example usage scenario, sequence diagram and design considerations in <<Rotate Command>>.

=== Save Feature
// tag::DGSave[]
This command applies the edits to the current image and saves it into `assets` directory.

==== Current Implementation
The `save` function is facilitated by `Album` and `CurrentEdit`. It uses the following operations:

* `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist()` - Returns `true` if `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit` is null. `tempImage` is null only if `open` command was never called.

* `CurrentEdit#getTempImage()` - Returns the latest edited image stored in `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit`.

* `CurrentEdit#getOriginalName()` - Returns the original name of opened image.

* `CurrentEdit#overwriteOriginal(String)` - Replaces `ori_img.png` with `temp_img.png` in `temp` directory. Updates `originalImage` to `tempImage` and `originalImageName` to `String` in `CurrentEdit`.

* `CurrentEdit#deleteHistory()` - Clears the history in `CurrentEdit`.

* `CurrentEdit#updateExif()` - Updates the Exif data of the new image.

* `Album#checkFileExist(String)` - Checks if the file name specified by the `String` exists in the assets directory.

* `Album#saveToAssets(Image, String)` - Saves the `Image` as `String` into `assets` directory.

* `Album#populateAlbum()` - Updates list of images in `Album` class.

* `Album#refreshAlbum()` - Updates and displays the latest images in `assets` directory on the GUI.


.Sequence Diagram for Save Command
image::SaveCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

The following is an example usage scenario of how `save` behaves at each step as shown in the figure above.

Step 1. The user executes `save`.

Step 2. `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist()` is called to check if an image was previously opened. If `open` was not called previously, `CommandException` is thrown.

Step 3. `CurrentEdit#getTempImage()` is called to retrieve the `tempImage` from `CurrentEdit`.

Step 4. If the user did not input a `String` after `save` previously, `CurrentEdit#getOriginalName()` will retrieve the `originalImageName` from `CurrentEdit`. Otherwise, `Album#checkFileExist(String)` will be called to check if a file name is similar to `String`. If it is a duplicate, `CommandException` will be thrown.

Step 5. `Album#saveToAssets(Image, String)` takes in the previously retrieved `Image` and `String` to create a new image file in `assets` directory.

Step 6. `CurrentEdit#overwriteOriginal(String)` is called to update the files in `temp` directory and their respective instances in `CurrentEdit`.

Step 7. `CurrentEdit#deleteHistory()` is called to delete the edit history in `CurrentEdit` so that the user can no longer perform `undo` on the saved image.

Step 8.`CurrentEdit#updateExif()` is called to update the Exif data of the new image.

Step 9. `Album#populateAlbum()` is called to update the list of images in the `Album` class and to ensure it reflects all the files in the `assets` directory.

Step 10.`Album#refreshAlbum()` is called to update the Information Panel on the GUI.


==== Design Considerations
* *Alternative 1*: The user must give a name to the new image.
** Advantage: Name of the new image is clear to the user.
** Disadvantage: May be tedious for the user to type in a name each time `save` is performed.

* *Alternative 2 (current choice)*: The user can choose to save as a new name or overwrite the original image
** Advantage: Convenient for the user to `save` quickly without having to type a new name every time.
** Disadvantage: The user may unintentionally overwrite the original image.

Alternative 2 was chosen as the user is likely to use `save` frequently. Since the `assets` directory functions like an album, images can be re-imported if they are accidentally overwritten. The user is able to `save` easily and choose to resume editing immediately or at a later time.
// end::DGSave[]


// tag::SavePreset[]
=== SavePreset Feature

This feature saves a list of commands that were applied to the opened image under a specified name so that they can be applied to other images in the future.

==== Current Implementation
The `savepreset` function is facilitated by `CurrentEdit` and `TransformationSet`. It uses the following operations:

* `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist()` - Returns `true` if `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit` is null. `tempImage` is null only if `open` command is never called.

* `CurrentEdit#getTempSubHistory()` - Retrieves the `List<Command>` from the `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit`.

* `TransformationSet#isPresent(String)` - Returns true if there is already a `List<Command>` saved under the same preset name.

* `TransformationSet#addTransformation(String, List<Command>)` - Saves the `List<Command>` to the `transformationMap` in `TransformationSet` under the specified preset name.

The following sequence diagram shows how `savepreset` works:

[[sequencediagram_savepreset]]
.Sequence Diagram for Save Preset Command
image::SavePresetCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how `savepreset` behaves at each step as shown in <<sequencediagram_savepreset>>.

Step 1. When the user enters the command (e.g. `savepreset preset1`), the entered command is parsed and the command will be executed.

[NOTE]
If an invalid command is provided, a reminder of how to use the command will be given to the user and no command will be executed.

Step 2. During execution, the `execute` method in the `SavePresetCommand` class first invokes `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist` to check if an image is opened. If no image is opened, an error message will be displayed to remind the user to open an image for editing first.

Step 3. If an image is opened, the `execute` method will invoke `CurrentEdit#getTempSubHistory()` to retrieve the `List<Command>` from the `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit` which consists of the image editing commands used on the opened image.

Step 4. If the `List<Command>` is empty, an error message will be displayed to indicate that the opened image is not edited yet and thus there are no commands to be saved as a preset.

Step 5. `TransformationSet#isPresent(String)` is then invoked to check if the preset name specified by the user is used previously. If it is used previously, an error message will be displayed to tell the user to specify a different preset name.

Step 6. Lastly, the method `TransformationSet#addTransformation(String, List<Command>)` is called to add the `List<Command` in the `TransformationSet`, saving it as a preset of commands that can be used in the future with the `setpreset` command.


==== Design Considerations
* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: The user can only save a preset of commands after applying these edits on an opened image.
** Pros: The user can view the effects of the commands on an image first before deciding to save it as a preset.
** Cons: It might be inconvenient for users who already have the list of commands they want to save as a preset beforehand and do not have to test them out.

* *Alternative 2*: The user can save a preset of commands by typing out all the commands in a row without testing them on an image.
** Pros: It will be convenient for professional editors as they do not have to test the commands out on an opened image first.
** Cons: Beginners in image editing will have a hard time finding the right commands to save as a preset without testing them out first.

In the end, the first alternative is chosen for this application because our photo editor, FomoFoto, is mainly designed for basic photo editing and thus should be more suitable for beginners to use.

// end::SavePreset[]

// tag::SetPreset[]
=== SetPreset Feature
This feature applies a preset list of commands that were saved previously using the `setpreset` command on the opened image.

==== Current Implementation
The `setpreset` function is facilitated by `CurrentEdit` and `TransformationSet`. It uses the following operations:

* `CurrentEdit#addCommand(Command)` - Adds this command to the edit history [`List<Command>`] in `tempImage` for the `undo/redo` command.

* `CurrentEdit#displayTempImage()` - Displays the temporary image stored in the temporary directory.

* `CurrentEdit#getTempImage()` - Retrieves the temporary image `tempImage` which stores the filepath of the temporary image, its history of edits [`List<Command>`] and its metadata.

* `CurrentEdit#replaceTempWithOriginal()` - Replaces the temporary image in the filepath of the `tempImage` with the original image.

* `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist()` - Returns `true` if `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit` is null. `tempImage` is null only if `open` command is never called.

* `TransformationSet#findTransformation(String)` - Retrieves the `List<Command>` in the `transformationMap` with the specified preset name.

* `TransformationSet#hasWaterMarkCommand(String)` - Returns true if the `List<Command>` contains a `WaterMarkCommand`.

* `TransformationSet#isPresent(String)` - Returns true if there is a `List<Command>` saved under the given preset name.

The following sequence diagram shows how `setpreset` works:

[[sequencediagram_setpreset]]
.Sequence Diagram for Set Preset Command
image::SetPresetCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how `setpreset` behaves at each step as shown in <<sequencediagram_setpreset>>.

Step 1. When the user enters the command (e.g. `setpreset preset1`), the entered command is parsed and the command will be executed.

[NOTE]
If an invalid command is provided, a reminder of how to use the command will be given to the user and no command will be executed.

Step 2. During execution, the `execute` method in the `SetPresetCommand` class first invokes `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist` to check if an image is opened. If no image is opened, an error message will be displayed to remind the user to open an image for editing first.

Step 3. If an image is opened, the `execute` method will invoke `CurrentEdit#getTempImage()` to retrieve the `tempImage` from `CurrentEdit`.

Step 4. `TransformationSet#isPresent(String)` is then invoked to check if there is a preset of commands saved under the name specified by the user. If the method returns false, an error message will be displayed to inform the user that there is no preset of commands saved under the name he/she specified.

Step 5. Else, the method `TransformationSet#findTransformation(String)` is called to retrieve the `List<Command>` saved under the specified preset name. `TransformationSet#hasWaterMarkCommand(String)` is also invoked to check if the `List<Command>` has a `WaterMarkCommand`.

Step 6. Commands in the `List<Command>` will be executed one by one to apply the respective edits to the opened image. If any of the commands throws an exception (e.g. If a watermark is already applied on an image, the execution of a preset of commands which contains a `WaterMarkCommand` on the same image will throw an error message to indicate that there is already a watermark.), the method `CurrentEdit#replaceTempWithOriginal` will undo all the changes made to the image.

Step 6. Lastly, `CurrentEdit#addCommand(this)` is invoked to add this command to the `List<Command>` in `tempImage` for the undo/redo function and `CurrentEdit#displayTempImage()` is used to display the edited image on the graphical user interface.

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Allows user to apply the preset of commands on only one image (the image that is opened) at each time.
** Pros: The user will be able to see the immediate effect of the commands on the image.
** Cons: The user has to set the preset of commands on different images one by one which takes a longer time.

* *Alternative 2*: Allows user to apply the preset of commands on multiple images.
** Pros: The user can save time by applying the commands on many images in just one command instead of having to do it one by one.
** Cons: The effects of the commands on the images are not shown immediately to the user and user will not be able to determine if the preset of commands is suitable for each of the images.

In the end, the first alternative is chosen as we want users to see the immediate effect of the commands so that they can make changes or undo the edits if they do not like what they see.

// end::SetPreset[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `Image`. It contains a list of commands applied to the current image. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Image#addHistory()` -- Saves the current edit command into commandHistory list and increments index.
* `Image#setUndo()` -- Decreases index by 1.
* `Image#setRedo()` -- Increases index by 1.
* `Image#getHistory()` -- Returns commandHistory as List.
* `Image#getSubHistory()` -- Returns commandHistory sublist using index to track which commands should be included.
* `Image#canUndo()` -- Returns true if index > 0.
* `Image#canRedo()` -- Returns true if index < CommandHistory.size().

These operations are exposed in the `CurrentEdit` interface as `CurrentEdit#addCommand()`, `CurrentEdit#setUndoTemp()`, `CurrentEdit#setRedoTemp()`, `CurrentEdit#getHistoryTemp()`, `CurrentEdit#getSubHistoryTemp()`, `CurrentEdit#canUndoTemp()` and `CurrentEdit#canRedoTemp()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user opens an image. The `Image` will be initialized with an empty commandHistory List.

.State list diagram for undo/redo
image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="600"]

Step 2. The user executes a series of transformations on the image. These transformations are stored in the commandHistory list and for each transformation stored, the index is incremented by 1 to point to that transformation.

.First Transformation
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="600"]
.Second Transformation
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="600"]

Step 3. The user wants to undo the previous transformation by using the `undo` command. It will call `CurrentEdit#replaceTempWithOriginal()` which will replace the edited image in temp folder with the original image. It will then call `CurrentEdit#setUndoTemp()` to set the index in `tempImage` to the required index and retrieve the list with `CurrentEdit#getHistoryTemp()`. Using the list, it will apply the commands onto the original image until it reaches the command just before the set index.

.Undo transformation
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="600"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will return the image before undo was called and produce an error message.

Step 4. After executing Undo, `index` will be less than the size of commandHistory. If redo is not executed before a new command is added, all commands in the list after `index` will be deleted.

For redo, it will call `setRedo` and retrieve that command to apply it on the current image.

.State List diagram
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="600"]

[NOTE]
If the `Image#index` is 0, pointing to the initial image, then there are no previous commands to restore. The `undo` command uses `CurrentEdit#canUndoTemp()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence Diagram
image::UndoSeqTEMP.PNG[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `CurrentEdit#setRedoTemp()`, which shifts the `index` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone command, and executes that command to perform the transformation.

[NOTE]
If the `index` is at index `commandHistory.size()`, pointing to the latest image state, then there is no undone transformation to restore. The `redo` command uses `CurrentEdit#canRedoTemp()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user executes `saves`, which calls `CurrentEdit#saveToAssets()`. This replaces the original image with the temp image since a name is not specified. When this happens, the user can no longer call `undo` as there is no original image to work on. The command history is also cleared.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* *Alternative 1:* Saves each transformation as a separate image.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* *Alternative 2(current choice):* Save all transformation in a list and apply them when undo/redo is called. We chose this method as we do not want our application to take up too much space in the PC.
** Pros: Will use less memory
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use a list to store the history of commands. We chose this so as to preserve good object-oriented programming principles.
** Pros: Easy for new computer science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `Image`.
* *Alternative 2:* Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates single responsibility principle and separation of concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]


=== WaterMark Feature
//tag::WaterMark[]
This command allows the user to add a watermark to their image. Upon receiving an input message from the user, the message will be checked for its validity and will throw an error if the message is empty or contains only spaces. Messages can contain words and numbers separated by spaces. The command will then be added to the `List<Commands>` belonging to `tempImage` found in `currentEdit` which saves the editing history of the targeted image.

[NOTE]
Each image can only have 1 watermark. If the user would like to edit the watermark, the user can remove the watermark by using the `Undo` function and then add a new watermark.

==== Current Implementation

The manipulation feature is facilitated by `CurrentEdit` and `Image`. It uses the following operations:

 * `CurrentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist()` - Returns `true` if `tempImage` in `CurrentEdit` is null. `tempImage` is null only if `open` command is never called.

 * `CurrentEdit#getTempImage` - Retrieves the temporary image `tempImage` which stores the filepath of the temporary image in the `temp` directory, its history of edits [`List<Command>`] and its metadata.

 * `CurrentEdit#updateTempImage` - Replaces the temporary image in `temp` directory with the newly edited image and updates the `tempImage` instance in the class.

 * `CurrentEdit#addCommand` - Adds this command to the edit history `List<Command>` in `tempImage` for the `undo/redo` command.

 * `CurrentEdit#displayTempImage()` - Displays the temporary image stored in the `temp` directory.

 * `Image#hasWaterMark()` - Checks if the `Image` already has a watermark.

 * `Image#setWaterMark(boolean)` - Sets the `Image` object's `hasWaterMark` field accordingly - if the `Image` object has or does not have a watermark.

The diagram below illustrates how the WaterMark Command works:

.Sequence Diagram for WaterMark Command
image::WaterMarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command should behave at each step:

Step 1. When the user runs an open command to edit an image, it invokes a method which creates an instance of an `Image` that stores the file path of the image, its history of edits `List<Command>` and its metadata. This `Image` object is saved under the variable name `tempImage` in `currentEdit` for editing.

Step 2. When the user enters the command (e.g. `wm FomoFoto`), the entered command is parsed and the command will be executed.

[NOTE]
If an invalid command is provided, a reminder of how to use the command will be given to the user and no command will be executed.

Step 3. During execution, the `execute` method in the `WaterMarkCommand` class first invokes `currentEdit#tempImageDoNotExist` to check if an image is opened. If no image is opened, it will throw an error message to inform the user to open an image for editing. Else, the `execute` method will invoke `currentEdit#getTempImage()` to get the `tempImage` from `CurrentEdit`.

Step 4. Upon retrieving the `tempImage`, the `execute` method in the `WaterMarkCommand` gets the  `BufferedImage` instance of the `tempImage` object and copies the `BufferedImage` object to a temporary `BufferedImage` object with the same width, height and image type. The `execute` method then initialises the necessary graphics properties using the `Graphics2D` Java class. The message is centralised and overlays the temporary `BufferedImage` object.

Step 5. The `execute` method then checks for a few conditions listed below:

. `isNewCommand`: Checks if the `WaterMark` command is from an input by the user, from an `undo/redo` command or from a `SetPreset` command.
. `isPreset`: Checks if the `WaterMark` command is from a preset.
. `tempImage#hasWaterMark()`: Checks if the `tempImage` already has a watermark.


Step 6. According to the above 3 conditions, the following combinations will result in different actions:

. `isNewCommand` = `True` and `tempImage#hasWaterMark()` = `False`:

+
* Invokes `tempImage#setWaterMark(True)` to indicate that the image has a watermark. +
+

+
* Invokes `currentEdit#updateTempImage()` to  save the newly edited `BufferedImage` and replace the previous image in the filepath of the `tempImage`.
+

+
* Sets `isNewCommand` to false to signal that this command is not a new rotate command if it is executed again through the `undo/redo` function.
+

+
* Invokes `currentEdit#addCommand(this)` to add this command to the `List<Command>` in `tempImage` for the `undo/redo` function and `currentEdit#displayTempImage()` is used to display the edited image on the graphical user interface.
+

.  `isNewCommand` = `True` and `tempImage#hasWaterMark()` = `True`:

+
* Throws an exception as there is already a watermark on `tempImage`.
+

.  `isNewCommand` = `False` and `isPreset` = `False`:

+
* Indicates that it is an `undo/redo` function.
+

+
* Invokes `tempImage#setWaterMark(true)` to indicate that the image has a watermark.
+

+
* Invokes `currentEdit#updateTempImage()` to save the newly edited `BufferedImage` and replace the previous image in the filepath of the `tempImage`.
+

.  `isNewCommand` = `False` and `isPreset` = `True` and `tempImage#hasWaterMark()` = `False`:
+
* Indicates that a preset is added to an image with no watermark.
+

+
* Invokes `tempImage#setWaterMark(true)` to indicate that the image has a watermark.
+

+
* Invokes `currentEdit#updateTempImage()` to save the newly edited `BufferedImage` and replace the previous image in the filepath of the `tempImage`.
+

. Anything else:

+
* Throws an exception as there is already a watermark on `tempImage`.

//end::WaterMark[]
==== Design Considerations

* Images that are still being edited have to be stored and edited in a temp directory first due to our `undo/redo` implementation.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE`: Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING`: Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO`: Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE`: Details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` directory, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]

Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` directory and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
