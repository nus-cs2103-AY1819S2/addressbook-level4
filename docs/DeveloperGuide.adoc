By: `Team W14-3`      Since: `Jan 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setup

To set up the project, the following must be installed on your machine:

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configuring the project writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the Battleships branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `attack a1`.

.Component interactions for `attack a1` command
image::HighLevelAttackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `Map`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `BattleshipParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. putting a ship).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

[[Design-Model]]
// tag::model[]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::model[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

// tag::model2[]
The `Model` component,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `PlayerStatistics` object that represents the user's statistics.
* manages the players, maps and ships in the game
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// end::model2[]

[[Design-Storage]]
// tag::storage[]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `PlayerStatistics` objects in json format and read it back.

//end::storage[]

// tag::battle[]

[[Design-Battle]]
=== Battle component

.Structure of the `Battle` Component and interactions with `Model` and `Logic`
image::BattleClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/battle/Battle.java[`Battle.java`]

// end::battle[]

The `Battle` component:

* keeps track of the progress of the battle,
* restricts the computer to place its ships at the correct time,
* allows the user and the computer enemy to attack each other and maintain proper turn-taking while doing so.

As the battle involves many different components (map, player, etc.),
this component cannot be reduced to just one interface class of `Battle`.



[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::map[]
=== Map feature

The map feature handles the interactions of the game in the map level. The map feature does the following:

* Initialise both players' maps.
* Allow placing of ships in the cells.
* Allow attacking of cells.

==== Implementation of map initialisation
The map feature is facilitated by `MapGrid` and `Cell`.
The map grid is stored internally in `MapGrid` as a 2D array of `Cell` objects.
`MapGrid` implements the following method to initialise the map:

* `MapGrid#initialise(Cell[][] map)` -- initialises the map using the given `Cell` 2D array.

Below is the code snippet for the `initialise` method. `cellGrid` is the internal 2D array comprising of `Cell` objects. +
The method `copy2dArray` copies the `map` parameter passed in to the internal `cellGrid`

[source,java]
----
include::../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/MapGrid.java[lines=39..46]
----

{empty} +

Below is the code snippet for the `copy2dArray` method. The `copy2dArray` method creates a new `Cell` object for each of the input `Cell` objects.
The copying is done using a constructor in `Cell` that takes in a parameter `Cell`.
This constructor copies the private attributes of the given `Cell` parameter.
[source,java]

The following activity diagram shows when the "initialise map" command can be used by the user:

.Activity diagram displaying when the user can initialise the maps
image::InitActivityDiagram.png[width=800]

{empty} +

==== Implementation of the `Cell` class
The cells are the lowest-level feature of the game and is represented by the `Cell` class. Each `Cell` allows one ship to be placed on it but the same ship can be referenced from multiple `Cell` objects. `Cell` also allows receiving of an attack and will propagate the attack call to the `Battleship` in it. To support the above, the following methods are available:

* `void putShip(Battleship ship)` - places a ship in the `Cell`.
* `boolean receiveAttack()` - receives an attack and returns true if it's a hit, false otherwise.

Also, each `Cell` has a `Status` attribute which is an `enum` of the following:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Status | Description
| HIDDEN | This cell has not been hit.
| EMPTY | This cell is empty and has not been hit.
| EMPTYHIT | This cell has been hit before, and is empty.
| SHIP | This cell has a ship in it.
| SHIPHIT | This cell has been hit before, and there is a damaged ship here.
| DESTROYED | This cell has been hit before, and the ship here has been destroyed.
|===

The `Status` of a `Cell` can be checked through the following method:

* `Status getStatus()` - returns the `Status` of the `Cell`.

The `Status` is used by several higher level functionality such as:

* the UI to know what colour should a `Cell` be displayed as.
* placing ships to check whether a ship has already been placed.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How the maps are initialised
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `MapGrid` will have an initialise method that takes in a 2D array of `Cell` objects.
The initialise method in `MapGrid` will then do a deep copy of the passed in 2D array to initialise the internal 2D array of `Cell`.

** Pros: The underlying 2D array in `MapGrid` is better protected from modification as it can only be modified through the initialise method.
** Cons: Might have more overhead due to deep copying.

* **Alternative 2:** `MapGrid` will have a getter method that returns the 2D array of `Cell`.
`InitialiseMapCommand` will then use this method to get the internal 2D array and populate it from outside of the `MapGrid` class.

** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: The 2D array within `MapGrid` is unprotected and open for modification.

Alternative 1 was chosen as the overhead is negligible and a defensive approach to the design is preferable.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the map
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** 2D array of `Cell` objects.
** Pros: Resulting code is simple and readable.
** Cons: More changes to be done from the original AB4 codebase.

* **Alternative 2:** List of lists of `Cell` objects.
** Pros: Easier to implement from the original AB4 codebase.
** Cons: Worse readability and more complicated compared to using a 2D array.

Alternative 1 was chosen because of good code readability and it being the simpler implementation.
Good code readability is important for new developers taking on the project.
Simpler implementation means the likelihood of bugs being introduced is less when changes are made.

// tag::putShip1[]

=== Ship Management feature

[NOTE]
====
The Ship Management feature is named as such to avoid confusion with the main title of the game, Battleship. In this section, the words "battleship" and "ship" are used interchangeably. The capitalised word `Battleship` in monospace font is used to refer to the Java class.
====

==== Current Implementation
The ship management feature handles the following:

* Putting ships on the map grid and ensuring that ships are placed in valid areas on the map grid.
* Keeping track of the status of ships in the player.

We can see the use case scenarios in the diagram below.

// end::putShip1[]

.Use case diagram for Ship Management
image::ShipManagementUseCaseDiagram.png[]

// tag::putShip2[]

`Battleship` is a class representing a ship that can be placed on the map grid. A `FleetEntry` class is internally used to store the `Battleship` in a player's `Fleet`. `FleetEntry` is a nested class within `Fleet` that contains a `Battleship`, its head `Coordinates` and its `Orientation` on the map grid.

The length of the ship varies depending on the type of ship. The user can tag a ship using a `t/[TAG]` parameter in the `put` command. Tagging a ship is optional. +

There are three types of ships and the number of each ship depends on the size of the map. The relationship between map size and the number of each ship is illustrated in the table below.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|============================================
|Type of Ship   |Length |Number
|Cruiser        |2      |`mapSize - 5`
|Destroyer      |3      |`(mapSize + 2) / 5`
|Aircraft carrier |5    |`1`
|============================================

The management of ships can be carried out with three commands, namely `put`, `listTags` and `list`.

===== Putting ships

The `put` command puts a ship on the map grid, specified by the __head coordinates__.

// end::putShip2[]

// tag::putShipHeadCoordinates[]

====
*__What are the head coordinates?__*

The head coordinates are the coordinates of the top-most and left-most cell of a ship. When coordinates are specified in the `put` command, they refer to the head coordinates of the ship.


image:BattleshipHeadExample.png[width=800]
====

// end::putShipHeadCoordinates[]

// tag::putShip3[]

The following operations are called when the `put` command is called.

* `performChecks()` - Performs checks to ensure that the ship can be put on the map.
* `putShip()` - Puts the ship into the cell.

The boundary checks are essential to the functionality of both the human and computer player. This is because `BoundaryValueChecker` is used by the human player in the `put` command and when the computer player deploying its own ships after the human player's turn has ended. `BoundaryValueChecker` relies on four separate methods to perform its checks. They are:

1. `isHeadWithinBounds()` - Checks if the head coordinates falls within the map grid.
1. `isBodyWithinBounds()` - Checks if the body of the ship falls within the map grid.
1. `isBattleshipAbsent()` - Checks if there are no other ships that are situated on the head coordinates.
1. `isClear()` - Checks if there are no other ships that situated along the body of the ship.

These methods check the horizontal and vertical boundaries when a ship is being deployed. They distinguish between the head and body of a ship in order to provide more specific feedback for the user. For the methods `isBattleshipAbsent()` and `isClear()`, `BoundaryValueChecker` calls the `getCellStatus()` method of the `mapGrid` object to obtain the status of `Cell` for checks.

Once `BoundaryValueChecker` has finished its checks and there are no exceptions thrown, the `put` command proceeds to call the `putShip()` method of the `mapGrid` object to put the ship on the map grid. It then updates the `Fleet` in the human player. The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the `put` command is called.

// end::putShip3[]

.Sequence diagram of putting a ship on the map.
image::PutShipSequenceDiagram.png[width=800, align="center"]


// tag::listTags[]

===== Listing tags

Ships can be tagged. You can list all the tags used by ships that have been deployed on the map grid with the `listTags` command. The command uses the `getAllTags()` method of the `Fleet` class. The code snippet below shows the operation of the `getAllTags()` method. The method returns a list of all the unique tags present in the player's fleet of deployed ships.

[source,java]
----
include::../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/player/Fleet.java[lines=204..209]
----


// end::listTags[]


// tag::listShips[]

===== Listing ships

Ships that have been deployed can also be listed in four different ways:

. List all ships: `list`
. List ships with certain tags: `list t/t1 t/t2`
. List certain ships: `list n/destroyer n/cruiser`
. List certain ships with certain tags: `list n/destroyer n/cruiser t/t1 t/t2`

The set of unique tags and the set of unique names are presented to the `ListCommand` as an `Optional` class. This is because both sets may be empty. In such cases, instead of redudantly checking whether each `fleetEntry` contains the ship and an empty set, `ListCommand` simply returns the entire fleet.

The `list` command can list certain ships with certain tags by filtering the list of deployed ships. The following sequence diagram shows how deployed ships are listed when the `list` command is entered into the command line.

// end::listShips[]

.Sequence diagram of listing ships deployed on the map.
image::ListShipSequenceDiagram.png[ align="center"]

// tag::ship_activity[]

==== Activity Diagram
Ship management functions throughout the entirety of the game. As there are multiple states during the game, it is beneficial to visualise the operations of the `put`, `listTags` and `list` commands with respect to the different game states. The activity diagram below illustrates these operations.

// end::ship_activity[]

.Activity diagram of ship management throughout the game.
image::ShipManagementActivityDiagram.png[height=400, align="center"]

// tag::ship_aspect_1[]

==== Design Considerations



===== Aspect: How a ship is placed on the map
* **Current choice:** +
 The same `Battleship` object is put in multiple cells. Each cell contains a reference to the same `Battleship` object. When a ship on the `Cell` needs to be modified, the `Battleship` attribute in the `Cell` is accessed.
** Pros: This allows any cell that is hit to access the same `Battleship` object without having to separately find the `Battleship` object.
** Cons: Difficult to keep track of each `Battleship` position.
* **Alternative:** +
Two separate `Battleship` and `BattleshipPart` objects are used. The `BattleshipPart` object represents the body of the `Battleship` and contains an attribute that points to the `Battleship`. When a battleship on the `Cell` needs to be modified, the `BattleshipPart` is accessed, which then accesses the main `Battleship` object.
** Pros: Clearer separation between the body of the ship and the ship itself.
** Cons: Difficult to handle hits on the cell.

// end::ship_aspect_1[]

// tag::ship_aspect_2[]

===== Aspect: How a ship is stored in each player's fleet
* **Current choice:** +
An `ArrayList` of `FleetEntry` objects is used for storage, where `FleetEntry` contains a reference to the `Battleship`, its `Orientation` and `Coordinates` of the head coordinates. The `FleetEntry` class is a nested class in `Fleet`. Whenever a `Fleet` method is called, it accesses the `ArrayList` of `FleetEntry` to obtain information about the `Battleship` and its position on the `MapGrid`.
** Pros: Can identify `Battleship` by position.
** Cons: Harder to implement, as a nested class has to be implemented from scratch, compared to using an `ArrayList`.
* **Alternative:** `ArrayList` of `Battleship`.
** Pros: Easier to implement and provides a cleaner design.
** Cons: Harder check position of `Battleship` on the map grid. In order to do so, a separate data structure must be created to store the coordinates and orientation of the ship. This data structure then has to be aligned with the original `ArrayList` that stores the ships.

// end::ship_aspect_2[]

// tag::battle_aspect_1[]
=== Battle feature
The Battle feature handles the following:

* keeping track of the stage of the battle, and ensuring that the player does not
  enter a command in the wrong stage of the game,
* allowing the computer to place its ships at the correct time,
* allowing the user and the computer enemy to attack each other and maintain proper turn-taking while doing so.

The Battle feature is split between several packages:

  * `seedu.address.battle`: the main `Battle` class is implemented here.
  * `seedu.address.battle.state`: the `BattleState` class is implemented here, and
    can be stored and retrieved via `Model`.
  * `seedu.address.battle.result`: the attack result classes are implemented here.
    These classes are returned by `Battle#humanPerformAttack(Coordinates)` and
    `Battle#takeComputerTurn()`.
  * `BeginCommand` and `AttackCommand` handle the player's interaction
    with this component.

In the following sections, we will explain the workings of each of these
different packages.

==== Implementation of battle state

.State diagram of the application
image::BattleStateDiagram.png[width=800]

In this program, there are certain commands that may only be executed at
specific phases of the game (e.g. `attack` must only be used when battling,
not while placing ships). To implement this, the battle state must be tracked.

The battle state is implemented as a `BattleState` enumeration, and stored
within the `Model`. When `LogicManager` executes a `Command` object, it checks
whether that command is allowed to be executed in the current state using
`Command#canExecuteIn(BattleState)`. Only if the command is allowed to execute
does `LogicManager` then call `Command#execute` - if it is not, then execution
is prevented and the user is notified.

In addition, certain commands may change the battle state - for example, `start`
changes the battle state from `PLAYER_PUT_SHIP` to `ENEMY_PUT_SHIP` then finally
to `PLAYER_ATTACK`.


==== Implementation of the `BattleManager` class
// end::battle_aspect_1[]
The `BattleManager` class contains four important methods, detailed as follows.

===== `void startGame()`

.Sequence diagram of the `startGame` method
image::StartGameSequenceDiagram.png[width=600]

`startGame` is called when the player begins the battle (via `BeginCommand`,
see next section for more details).

`startGame` prepares the `Enemy` for battle by calling `Enemy#prepEnemy`,
which causes the enemy to place its ships and set up other data structures.
For more information, please see the "Enemy AI Feature" section below.

===== `AttackResult performAttack(Player, Player, Coordinates)`

.Sequence diagram of the `performAttack` method
image::PerformAttackSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

`performAttack` is the method that actually performs the attack from one
player to another. It takes in an attacker `Player`, a target `Player` and
the attacked `Coordinates`, and returns an `AttackResult`. (See section
3.3.3 for the description of what `AttackResult` is returned in what scenario.)

This method is an internal method, used by both `humanPerformAttack` and
`takeComputerTurn`.

===== `AttackResult humanPerformAttack(Coordinates)`

.Sequence diagram of the `humanPerformAttack` method
image::HumanPerformAttackSequenceDiagram.png[width=300]

`humanPerformAttack` is called when the player makes an attack (via
`AttackCommand`, see below.)

This method simply calls `performAttack` with the human player as the
attacker, the computer player as the target and the argument coordinate
as the attacked coordinate.

// tag::battle_aspect_2[]
===== `List<AttackResult> takeComputerTurn()`

.Sequence diagram of the `takeComputerTurn` method
image::TakeComputerTurnSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

`takeComputerTurn` is called after the player makes an attack but misses
(via `AttackCommand`, see below). As mentioned in the game rules, after
the player misses the computer may begin to attack until it misses, and
this method implements that functionality.

==== Implementation of attack result

The representation of the result of an attack is the class `AttackResult` and
its subclasses. To help the receiver in deciphering the attack result without
needing to resort to `instanceof`, methods are provided to test for attributes
such as whether the attack is a hit.

The methods are:

    * `isSuccessful`: tests whether the attack actually completed
    * `isHit`: tests whether the attack damaged a ship
    * `isDestroy`: tests whether the attack destroyed the ship
    * `isWin`: tests whether the attack caused the attacker to win

A summary of each type of `AttackResult` can be seen from the following table:

[width="88%",cols="22%,66%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Result type          |Scenario
|`AttackFailed`       |The `Coordinates` provided was out of bounds, or
                       some error occurred during the attack.
|`AttackMissed`       |The attack did not hit an enemy ship.
|`AttackHit`          |The attack hit an enemy ship but did not sink it.
|`AttackDestroyedShip`|The attack hit an enemy ship and sank it,
                       but the enemy still has ships remaining.
|`AttackDefeatedEnemy`|The attack hit the last of the enemy's ships and sank
                       it, resulting in a victory for the attacker.
|=======================================================================


==== Implementation of player interaction via commands

.Use case diagram of the `Battle` Component.
image::BattleUseCaseDiagram.png[width=800]

.Activity diagram of the process of battling.
image::BattleActivityDiagram.png[width=800]

The upper diagram is a use case diagram which shows briefly the possible
interactions between the user and the application during the battling phase.
Below is a more detailed activity diagram of what happens when the
user does battle against the computer enemy. As shown, the player
does battle by using the `begin` command to initiate the battle,
then the `attack` command to attack the enemy.

The following sequence diagrams show what happens when the user enters
the `begin` command, then the `attack a1` command.

.Sequence diagram of `begin`.

.Sequence diagram of `attack a1`.
image::AttackSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

==== Design considerations
* **Current choice:** +
  `BattleManager` is stored under `Model`. Every time `Attack` or `Begin` commands
  are executed, they will use this `BattleManager` to actually perform the actions,
  with the logic in the `Command`-s mostly being error handling. +
  When AI performs attacks, the `BattleManager` will call the AI to compute its attack
  and return it, then call an internal method to actually perform the attack.
** Pros:
*** Command logic is abstracted into places where it can be reused by the AI.
*** Flow of program is clear - it always is a higher level component calling a lower-level component. +
    (e.g. when the player types in an Attack command, user interacts with `UI`, which calls `Logic`,
    which calls `Model` and `BattleManager`,
    which call the lowest level classes `Map` and `Player`)
** Cons:
*** The `Model` component now contains game logic (`BattleManager`) within it.
* **Alternative** +
  `BattleManager` is stored under `Logic`. Every time `Attack` or `Begin` commands
  are executed, they will perform the action using the logic coded within themselves, not
  interfacing with `BattleManager`. +
  When AI performs attacks, the `BattleManager` will create these commands and execute them.
  In the `Model`, the current attacking player is kept track of, allowing the commands to be
  used for both a human and AI player.
** Pros:
*** The game's model and logic are kept separate from each other.
** Cons:
*** `AttackCommand` is now state-dependent (the state being the current attacking player) which
    can more easily lead to bugs and race conditions.

+
In the end, we decided to implement Option 1. Even though some team members preferred either option,
we decided that `Logic` and `Model` not being kept separate was a worthy tradeoff
for the advantages of Option 1.

=== Enemy AI feature

The enemy player serves as a computerised opponent for this single-player game.

// tag::enemyCurrentImplementation[]
==== Current implementation
The Enemy AI feature is currently implemented as an extension of the Player class,
and serves as the opponent player since `Battleship` is a single-player game.
The Enemy AI can automatically perform initialising actions similar to the human player.
Mainly, the Enemy AI can randomly initialise its own mapGrid with randomly generated ships,
which is invoked by the command `start game`.

We can see these scenarios here:

.Use Case Diagram for Enemy Deploying Ships
image::EnemyDeployingUseCaseDiagram.png[width=600]

The Enemy AI also supports the ability for the enemy to automatically and intelligently shoot
the player's map when the player ends their turn, encapsulated by these scenarios:


.Use Case Diagram for Enemy Shooting
image::EnemyShootingUseCaseDiagram.png[width=600]

Note that the Enemy AI feature does not contain any explicit commands to be
entered by the Player. Its methods are called by other features instead, and does its
magic in the background.
// end::enemyCurrentImplementation[]


// tag::enemyInitialiseMap[]

==== Initialisation of Enemy MapGrid

The Enemy AI has the method `populateMapGrid()` which is called by the method `prepEnemy()`,
which is in turn called by the Battle Manager when the Player enters the command `start game`.


.Sequence Diagram for prepEnemy()
image::PrepEnemySequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

It can be seen from the above sequence diagram that `populateMapGrid()` goes on to call the methods
`placeAirCraftCarrier()` and `placeMultipleDestroyerAndCruiser()`.

`placeAirCraftCarrier()` is called once, and places only one `Aircraft Carrier` onto the map, since the game rules state that
no matter the map size, every game will only feature a single `Aircraft Carrier`.

On the other hand, `placeMultipleDestroyerAndCruiser()` is called twice consecutively. The first call takes in the parameters required
to put as many `Destroyers` as available onto the enemy map, while the second call will do so for `Cruisers`.

The reason why `placeMultipleDestroyerAndCruiser()` is called twice is because the implementation to place `Destroyers` and `Cruisers`
are identical, but we still want to keep their placement separate for better abstraction and easier testing.

The following two sequence diagrams illustrate how `placeAirCraftCarrier()` and `placeMultipleDestroyerAndCruiser()` prepare the
enemy ships and put them on the enemy map grid.

**Sequence Diagram for `placeAirCraftCarrier()`**

.Sequence Diagram for placeAirCraftCarrier()
image::PlaceAirCraftCarrierSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

**Sequence Diagram for `placeMultipleDestroyerAndCruiser()`**

.Sequence Diagram for placeMultipleDestroyerAndCruiser()
image::PlaceMultipleDestroyerAndCruiserSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]


`populateMapGrid()` will generate randomised ships based on the number of ships
available to it for the current game, as specified in its Parent class - Player.
The number of ships available to the Enemy AI is congruent to the number of ships
available to the Player. The exact number of the different types of ships is decided from on
a formula that is based on the map size specified by the player in the `init` command.
// end::enemyInitialiseMap[]

// tag::enemyShoot[]
==== Calculation of Coordinate to Attack

The Enemy AI has the method `enemyShootAt()` that is invoked when the player ends their turn upon a miss.
The Enemy AI will attempt to generate a random Coordinate to attack,
and pass this Coordinate to the `BattleManager`. The Enemy AI supports the ability to
check that its generated coordinates are all valid, and will perform certain calculations that will
increase its accuracy upon detecting a successful hit on any part of a ship.

The following activity diagram illustrates the conditions taken into account by the Enemy AI as part of its shooting algorithm, and shows
how it decides on which Coordinate to target, depending on the success of previous hits.

.Activity Diagram of the Enemy Shooting Process
image::EnemyShootingActivityDiagram.png[width=800]


We can see from the diagram that the start of the game, when scouting for the Player's ships, the Enemy first divides the cells with a parity of 1
on the map into two groups - we will name these groups White and Black for ease of explanation.
The enemy will then randomly pick a Coordinate from the White group whenever it is guessing where the
next Player ship might be. The reason for this is that since every ship must be at least of length 2, all ships will
consist of at least one of each White or Black coordinates.

The Black-White groupings of Coordinates through the concept of parity is illustrated here in the following diagram:

.Checkered Board illusrating concept of parity
image::CheckeredBoard.png[width=650]

Once the Enemy hits a Coordinate that has a ship on it, it will note down every valid Coordinate that is cardinal (to the North, South, East and West) to the
cell that was discovered to hold a ship.

.Examples of valid and invalid cardinal coordinates
image::CardinalCoordinates.png[width=650]

The validity of these cardinal Coordinates are evaluated by checking if they are within the bounds of the map grid, and
whether they have not been hit before. If these two conditions are satisfied, then the Enemy will note down the cardinal Coordinate into a `watchlist`, and
will from that point shoot everything in the `watchlist`, until the ship that it is targeting is destroyed.

When the Enemy AI detects that it has successfully destroyed the Player ship, it will empty out the `watchlist`, and go back to scouting the
map for another part of the Player ship, by randomly targeting coordinates in the Black cells, as illustrated in the previous image.

The following code snippet gives a clearer view of how the algorithm flows for the enemy shooting strategy:
[source,java]
----
include::../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/player/Enemy.java[lines=85..105]
----

__Note: All actions taken by the Enemy AI are seeded by a pseudo-random generator.
Thus, its behaviour will be different for every game session.__

// end::enemyShoot[]

// tag::enemyDesign[]

==== Design considerations
* **Current choice:** seed all methods with pseudo-random seed
** Pros: each game will be a different experience
** Cons: testing will be more difficult
* **Alternative:** pre-calculate and hardcode the actions the Enemy AI performs
** Pros: testing is made very much easier
** Cons: games would be less dynamic since the enemy's behaviour is non-organic
// end::enemyDesign[]

// tag::stats[]
=== Statistics feature
==== Current implementation
The statistics feature allows users to view their current gameplay information. This information will be displayed in a
pop-up window that includes: Number of Attacks Made, Number of Successful Hits, Number of Misses and Number of Enemy Ships
 Destroyed. The statistics command can be called at any juncture of the game.

Upon a successful win game, the statistics feature also implements a save command that automatically saves the
statistical data into the game's storage. At the same time, the command will retrieve the statistical data from the
previous game and perform a comparison of game data.

The following operations are invoked upon the calling of the `stats` command.

** `getAttacksMade()` - Returns the number of attacks made by the User.
** `getMovesLeft()` - Returns the remaining number of moves left for the User.
** `getHitCount()` - Returns the number of successful hit on enemy ships.
** `getMissCount()` Returns the number of misses made.
** `getEnemyShipsDestroyed()` Returns the number of Enemy Ships Destroyed by the player.
** `getAccuracy()` Returns the current Hit-Miss Ratio of the User based on the game so far.
** `generateData()` Formats the current statistical data into a json serializable format.

==== Display statistics

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `stats` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The User initializes the game with the `init 8` which will create a 8x8 map.

[Note]
The Map can be initialized to any valid size (This is just a sample scenario)

Step 2. Put the ships onto the grid via the `put` ship command.

Step 3. Input `stats` into the command-line and press enter to obtain the current statistical data.

Inputting `stats` :

image::inputStatsCommandSS.png[width=200]

Pop-up window for `stats` :

.Screenshot of empty statistics pop-up window.
image::StatsWindowSS.png[width=350]

There should not be any valid data at the moment as the game as not started.

Step 4. Now proceed with the game and perform an attack. Input `attack a1`.

Step 5. Invoke the `stats` command again to view the updated statistics of the attack result.

.Screenshot of populated statistics pop-up window.
image::StatsWindowUpdatedSS.PNG[width=350]

Besides the pop-up window, the data is also captured in the command-line result box.

image::StatsCommandBox.PNG[width=200]

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a User invokes the `stats` command.

.Sequence diagram of `stats` command.
image::StatsSequenceDiagram.PNG[width=600 ]

==== Save and Compare
Given below is an example usage scenario of the automatic save and compare feature.

1. Upon winning a game, a user will be presented with the following screen.

image::StatsWinScreen.PNG[width=350]
Notice the displayed 'Statistics Analysis' section that displays a comparison of the player's accuracy in the current game and
the previous game.

2. By inputting `init 6` and press enter. The game will be restarted with a new map.

3. Next, input the command `stats` to observe how the previous statistics data has also been cleared in preparation for the
new game.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens at the end of a game and an automatic save is
performed.

.Sequence diagram of how the statistics data is saved.
image::SaveSequenceDiag.PNG[width=350]

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens at the end of the game where an automatic reading of previous
statistics data is performed.

==== Activity Diagram
The following Activity Diagram shows when the `stats` command can be used.

image::StatisticsActivityDiagram.png[width=450]


==== Use Case Diagram
The following use-case diagram captures the behaviour of the statistics feature.


.Use case diagram on the statistics feature.
image::StatsUseCaseDiag.PNG[width=250]


==== Design considerations
===== Design of data-tracking methods
* **Alternative 1:** The methods that are responsible for incrementing the relevant game data are placed
in each of the commands to be tracked. This meant that there would be a method call to the statistics class
from within every method itself, which also meant that every method had to contain a parameter for the PlayerStatistics Object.
** Pros: The methods are clearly visible within each command to be tracked and as a developer I can understand when each
command is being tracked.
** Cons: This implementation violates the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice) :** The method responsible for incrementing the statistical data is placed only at the AttackCommand class.
** Pros: The implementation does not violate the DRY principle and contains less dependencies on the other components.
** Cons: It is more difficult to code as it has to account for different CommandResult objects.

===== Type of Storage File
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)** : Use JSON file to store statistics data
** Pros: Easy to implement as there are libraries pre-installed.
** Cons: Formatting errors are not validated
* **Alternative 2 ** : Use XML file to store statistics data
** Pros: Can put metadata into the tags in  the form of attributes.
** Cons: Difficult to code as it is less readable and external libraries must be imported.

//end::stats[]

=== Logs

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-3 team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Tests

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.BattleManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reports

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Dependency management

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

   Expected: Displays two empty map grids of size 7 in the GUI. Both maps will have the appropriate alphanumeric labels on the first row and column.
.. Test case: `init 0` +
   Expected: If this is the first command ran, no map will be displayed. Otherwise, no changes will be made to the displayed maps.
   Error message will be displayed in the result display box.
.. Other incorrect initialise commands to try: `init`, `init x` (where x is smaller or larger than the specified minimum or maximum map size respectively). +
   Expected: No map will be displayed if this is the first command ran. Otherwise, no changes will be made to the displayed map.

=== Putting a ship

. Putting a ship on the map after initialising the map.

.. Prerequisites: There are ships in your fleet ready to be deployed. This means that the number of ship in the fleet is more than 0. The map is initialised to a size between 6 and 10.
.. Test case: `put n/destroyer r/horizontal c/b1` +
   Expected: Destroyer ship of size 3 will be put horizontally on coordinates `b1`, `b2` and `b3`. The map is updated with 3 black cells on each of these coordinates representing the Destroyer ship.
.. Test case: `put n/aircraft carrier r/horizontal c/c1 t/bluefleet` +
   Expected: Aircraft Carrier ship of size 5 will be put horizontally on coordinates `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` and `c5`. The map is updated with 5 black cells on each of these coordinates representing the Aircraft Carrier ship.
.. Test case: `put n/aircraft carrier r/horizontal c/e1 t/nomore` +
   Expected: No ship is put down on the map. Error details shown in the status message. Map remains the same.

=== Starting the battle

. To test `begin`, we will test that it is only able to be executed at certain times.
  Please follow the following steps in order.

.. Start the application, then execute `begin`. +
   Expected result: The battle does not begin, and an error message is displayed in the result box.
.. Execute `init 6`, then execute `begin`. +
   Expected result: The battle does not begin, and an error message is displayed in the result box.
.. Place one or more ships using `put`, then execute `begin`. +
   Expected result: the battle successfully begins and a message stating as such is displayed.
.. Execute `begin` again.
   Expected result: an error message is displayed in the result box.

// end::starttest[]

// tag::battletest[]

=== Attacking

. To test `attack`, we will need to play through the game.
  Please follow the following steps in order.

.. Start the application, then execute `attack`. +
   Expected result: no attack is executed, and an error message is displayed.
.. Execute `init 6`, and place your ships on the board.
.. Execute `begin`.
.. Make an attack on a square that is out of bounds, e.g. `attack a9`. +
   Expected result: no attack is executed, and
   a prompt to select another cell is displayed.
.. Make an attack on a valid square that **misses**. +
   Expected result: the attacked square on the enemy map turns dark blue, and
   a "miss" message is displayed. The enemy also makes one or more moves.
.. Make an attack on a square you have already attacked.
   Expected result: no attack is executed, and
   a prompt to select another cell is displayed.
.. Make an attack on a valid square that **hits**.  +
   Expected result: the attacked square on the enemy map turns orange, and
   a "hit" message is displayed.
.. Make an attack that **destroys a ship**. +
   Expected result: the destroyed ship on the enemy map turns red, and
   a "destroy" message is displayed.
.. Destroy all the enemy's ships. +
   Expected result: a "win" message is displayed.
.. Start another battle, then have all your ships be destroyed by the enemy. +
   Expected result: a "lose" message is displayed.

=== Viewing the statistics

To test the `stats` feature. We will perform a before and after check to see if the statistical data of a simple behaviour is captured. In this case, we will perform an attack with a miss result.

1. Initialize a 8x8 map using `init 8`.
2. Run the `stats` command and observe the results
.. Test case : `stats`  (before) +
   Expected: All fields are 0.
3. Now input `attack c1` to simulate an attack on the enemy map.
.. Test case : `stats` (after) +
    Expected: Number of attacks : 1, Number of Misses : 1
//end::statstest[]

//tag::savetest[]
=== Saving statistics data

To test the statistics save and compare feature. We will use a debug command `save`.

1. Initialize a 8x8 map using `init 8`.
2. Input `save` into the command box and press enter.
.. Test case : `save` (start of game) +
   Expected: Accuracy is same as before at 0%. This is because the application
   automatically compares to a default state of 0 if there is no previous game.
3. Now play the game until you win.
4. At the end of the game, the `save` command will be automatically called.
.. Test case : Win the game +
    Expected: A comparison is made between your current game accuracy and the previous
    game accuracy which is 0. Your accuracy has improved.
