== Introduction

Hello! My name is Tan Mei Yen and I am currently a second year student studying Computer Science at National University of Singapore. +

This Personal Project Portfolio details the contributions which I have made to the Equipment Manager project for CS2103T Software Engineering module. My main responsibilites are implementing command features which are `filter` and `sort` and also ensuring proper documentation in the user and developer guide.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in further detail and other relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.


== Project: Equipment Manager

== Overview
_Equipment Manager_ is a desktop CLI (Command Line Interface) application that allows engineers to keep track on the Preventive Maintenance schedule of all Resuscitation Devices in Singapore. It has a GUI (Graphic User Interface) that allows users to get further information on each equipment. +

If you are an engineer that uses the computer frequently and want to improve efficiency at work, why not try out
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/releases[_Equipment Manager_]? No installation is required!

Main Features of _Equipment Manager_:

* Viewing of equipment information through typing
* Searching and filtering by equipment serial number, equipment status or work list
* Display equipment location in Google Maps
* Plan the most efficient route to take for visiting multiple locations


== Summary Of Contributions

This section is to provide a summary of my contributions to the project.

* *Enhancement 1*: added the ability to *filter the equipment list according to specified fields*
** What it does: The `filter` command allows the user to filter the equipment list which matches the given fields:
*** Name
*** Address
*** Date
*** Phone
*** Tags
*** Serial Number

** Justification: The user can filter the list with certain fields, expediting the search process, and reducing the time needed to find an equipment and its details.

** Highlights:
*** The command is simple to use and allows multiple fields to filter by.
*** If users were to forget what are the fields available, error messages would guide them to execute the commands correctly.

** Credits: Code from `FindCommand` was referenced in the implementation of `FilterCommand`


* *Enhancement 2*: added the ability to *sort the equipment list according to specified fields*
** What it does: The `sort` command allows the user to sort the equipment list by the given fields:
*** Name
*** Date
*** Serial Number
*** Phone

** Justification: The user can sort the equipment list in lexicographical order for better viewing purposes.

** Highlights:
*** The command is simple to use and allows the user to sort the list by their own preferences.
*** If users were to forget what are the fields available, error messages would guide them to execute the commands correctly.
