== Introduction

Hi, I am Liu Xuan, a year 2 Computer Science student, studying at National University of Singapore.

I am working on a software product with my project teammates, Rachel, Mei Yen and Sun Yiqun. This project portfolio will
specify and illustrate which part I was working on.

== PROJECT: Equipment Manager

== Overview

*Equipment Manager* is a Command Line Interface Software Product, which helps engineers to better manage their equipments.
This application allows users to arrange and organize their equipments, assign the equipment maintenance work into a person and a specified
date, and have a best routing plan.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: constructed *a feature that helps users to have a collection of their equipments, named WorkList.*
** What it does: allows the user to create a work list, and put some equipments into a work list.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it can help users to effectively allocate
   equipment maintenance work to their staff.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the whole model and structure. It required an in-depth analysis of the
   relationships between the WorkList and the Equipment. In addition, it also required more commands to be added into
   this software. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the model and the commands. This feature
   also helps users to better organize their equipments and assign the maintenance work to some person.
** AddWorkListCommand: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/pull/79[#79]] [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/pull/97[#97]]
** DeleteWorkListCommand: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/pull/182[#182]]
** PutCommand: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/pull/109[#109]]

** ListWorkListCommand: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/pull/65[#65]]
** Credits: Code from `AddWorkListCommand` and `DeleteWorkListCommand` was referenced in the implementation of `AddCommand` and `DeleteCommand` respectively
** Credits: Code from `ListWorkListCommand` was referenced in the implementation of `ListEquipmentCommand`
//** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_
