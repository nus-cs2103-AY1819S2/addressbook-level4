== PROJECT: The Food Diary

---

== Overview


This project portfolio page serves to document my contributions to _The Food Diary_, a software engineering project undertaken
as part of the National University of Singapore(NUS) School of Computing's Software Engineering module,CS2103T.
More information on this module can be found https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/V1/lms/public/view_moduleoutline.aspx?CourseID=DBE4B268-893E-4DCB-9666-0E9150581F2A&ClickFrom=StuViewBtn[here]

The Food Diary is a *journal application* for food lovers in Singapore to record their reviews of restaurants they have visited and
receive recommendations of restaurants for future visits. The user interacts with the application using a Command Line Interface(CLI).
It also contains a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10,000 Lines of Code.


== Summary of contributions


* *Major enhancement*: I added *the ability to get restaurant recommendations based on proximity to a location.*
** What it does: This feature allows the user to list restaurants that they have not reviewed, based on the proximity of the restaurant to the location they provide.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can receive recommendations based on their current location, making it a lot more convenient for them to find restaurants.
** Highlights: This enhancement required the creation of multiple components to function. Firstly, a Python script was used to collect
 the postal data and parse it into a json file. Secondly, a new storage system was created to parse the postal data json file.
  Finally, this data was then used to sort the restagiurants.
** Credits: https://docs.onemap.sg/[OneMap API] was used to generate the postal data.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added a name command that allows users to *personalise The Food Diary with their own name.*

* *Code contributed*: The code that I have contributed to this project can be found https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=chanqingzhou[here]
