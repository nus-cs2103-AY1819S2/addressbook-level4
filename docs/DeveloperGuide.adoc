== Introduction

RestOrRant (ROR) is a restaurant management application for restaurant managers, waiters and cashiers. ROR is designed for them to perform front-end operations more conveniently and efficiently. It allows them to manage tables, orders, menu and statistical data using the Command Line Interface (CLI).

This Developer Guide allows you as a developer to understand the implementation and design principles used in ROR. This guide serves as a reference for you to set up and further contribute to ROR’s development.

This Developer Guide consists of the following sections:

* <<Setting Up, Setting Up>> - Provides instructions to set up ROR in your computer
* <<Design, Design>> - Provides an overview of the architecture and components of ROR
* <<Implementation, Implementation>> - Provides implementation and design considerations of ROR’s core features
* <<Documentation, Documentation>> - Provides instructions to edit and publish documentation
* <<Testing, Testing>> - Provides methods to run and troubleshoot tests
* <<Dev Ops, Dev Ops>> - Provides tools to help build, test and release ROR

== Setting Up

This section will guide you along the process of setting up ROR in your computer.

=== Prerequisites

Before you proceed, there are two prerequisites you will need to fulfill:

. *JDK 9* or later
+
[IMPORTANT]
JDK *10* on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK *9*.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to menu:File[Settings > Plugins] to re-enable them.

=== Setting up ROR in your computer

Having satisfied the prerequisites, you can now set up ROR in your computer by following the steps below:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click menu:File[Close Project] to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click menu:Configure[Project Defaults > Project Structure]
.. Click btn:[New...] and find the directory of the JDK
. Click btn:[Import Project]
. Locate the [.java]#build.gradle# file and select it. Click btn:[OK]
. Click btn:[Open as Project]
. Click btn:[OK] to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the *BUILD SUCCESSFUL* message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[[.java]#MainWindow.java#] and check for
any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select btn:[Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options] for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[[.java]#HelpWindowTest.java#] for code
errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

To make sure that your ROR is properly set up:

. Run the [.java]#seedu.address.MainApp# and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

You should ensure that the following configurations are done to be compatible with ROR.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to menu:File[Settings...] (Windows/Linux), or menu:IntelliJ IDEA[Preferences...] (macOS)
. Select menu:Editor[Code Style > Java]
. Click on the *Imports* tab to set the order

* For *Class count to use import with 'pass:[*]'* and *Names count to use static import with 'pass:[*]'*: Set to *999* to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For *Import Layout*: The order is btn:[import static all other imports], btn:[import java.\*], btn:[import javax.*], btn:[import org.\*], btn:[import com.*], btn:[import all other imports]. Add a blank line between each import

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the *se-edu/addressbook-level4* repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to *se-edu/addressbook-level4*), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/build.gradle[[.java]#build.gradle#], such as the [.java]#site-name#, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute [.java]#repoURL# in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[[.java]#DeveloperGuide.adoc#] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[[.java]#UserGuide.adoc#] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

Now that you have successfully set up ROR, you are advised to read this section in order to better understand the architecture and its components in ROR. Knowing the structure of ROR and the interactions between its components will allow you to better navigate and modify the code, giving you a headstart in contributing to ROR.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The _Architecture Diagram_ given below explains the high-level design of the ROR App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

[TIP]
The *.pptx* files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file,
select the
objects of the diagram, and choose btn:[Save as picture] and save your new diagram into the
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/images/[images] folder.

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[.java]#Main# has only one class called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[[
.java]#MainApp#]. It has two functions:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method(s) where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,[.java]#Commons#>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* [.java]#LogsCenter# : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,[.java]#UI#>> : The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,[.java]#Logic#>> : The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,[.java]#Model#>> : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,[.java]#Storage#>> : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its API in an interface with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a [.java]#{Component Name}Manager# class.

For example, the [.java]#Logic# component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the [.java]#Logic.java# interface and exposes its functionality using the [.java]#LogicManager.java# class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `addTable 2`.

.Component interactions for `addTable 2` command
image::SDforAddTable.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The UI component (Figure 4) handles the User Interface of ROR.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[[.java]#Ui.java#]

The UI consists of a [.java]#MainWindow# that is made up of parts such as [.java]#CommandBox#, [.java]#ResultDisplay# and [.java]#StatusBarFooter#. All these, including the [.java]#MainWindow#, inherit from the abstract [.java]#UiPart# class. Not all the parts are displayed to the user at the same time (eg. [.java]#TableFlowPanel# is not shown together with [.java]#StatisticsFlowPanel#). The parts that are shown depends on the <<Modes, mode>>.

The [.java]#UI# component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching *.fxml*
files that are in the [.java]#/blob/master/src/main/resources/view# folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[[.java]#MainWindow#] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[[.java]#MainWindow.fxml#].

The [.java]#UI# component:

* Executes user commands using the [.java]#Logic# component.
* Listens for changes to [.java]#Model# data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The Logic component (Figure 5) deals with the logic behind the execution of commands.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[[.java]#Logic.java#]

*  [.java]#Logic# uses the [.java]#RestOrRantParser# class to parse the user command.
*  This results in a [.java]#Command# object which is executed by the [.java]#LogicManager#.
*  The command execution can affect the [.java]#Model# (e.g. adding a table).
*  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a [.java]#CommandResult# object which is passed back to the [.java]#Ui#.
*  In addition, the [.java]#CommandResult# object can also instruct the [.java]#Ui# to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user or changing the <<Modes, mode>> displayed.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the [.java]#Logic# component for the [.java]#execute("addTable 2")# API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addTable 2` Command
image::AddTableSdforLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The Model component (Figure 7) keeps a model of the current state of ROR in memory.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[[.java]#Model.java#]

The [.java]#Model# :

* stores a [.java]#UserPref# object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the RestOrRant data.
* exposes an unmodifiable [.java]#ObservableList<Table>#, [.java]#ObservableList<OrderItem>#, [.java]#ObservableList<MenuItem># and [.java]#ObservableList<Revenue># that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The Storage component (Figure 8) manages the storing and retrieving of data on local files.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[[.java]#Storage.java#]

The [.java]#Storage# component:

* saves [.java]#UserPref# objects in json format and reads it back.
* [.java]#LogicManager# calls for each of [.java]#Tables#, [.java]#Orders#, [.java]#Menu# and [.java]#Statistics# to be saved when they are modified.
* saves the [.java]#Tables#, [.java]#Orders#, [.java]#Menu# and [.java]#Statistics# data in json format and reads it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the [.java]#seedu.address.commons# package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how our features are implemented.

=== Mode System

==== Modes

As ROR contains many features, users may find it complicated to handle all the features at one go with so many commands to use. Furthermore, users may be overwhelmed if all the restaurant's information were to be displayed together in one screen.

As such, we have decided to implement a mode system for ROR to organise the available commands into their respective features. ROR provides 4 different modes for the users, each displaying a different set of panels that are relevant to the mode:

* *Restaurant Mode* - perform <<Tablesf, table-related operations>> across the entire restaurant
* *Table Mode* - perform <<Ordersf, order-related operations>> for a specific table
* *Menu Mode* - perform <<Menuf, menu-related operations>> on the restaurant's menu
* *Statistics Mode* - perform <<Statisticsf, queries>> to retrieve the restaurant's statistics

To use the different features, we have also implemented commands for users to switch between the 4 user modes.

[[BillMode]]
There is also a *Bill Mode* available for your use as a developer, although the existence of this mode is not shared with the users. The Bill Mode displays the receipt and is only used after the `bill` command is executed in RestOrRant.

[NOTE]
Although the `bill` command is used in Table Mode, it is considered a <<Statistics feature, Statistics feature>> rather than an Orders feature as it involves calculation for the revenue.


[[ChangeMode]]
// tag::changemode[]
==== Current Implementation

[[ChangingModes]]
===== Changing modes in general

The modes of the application are defined using a [.java]#Mode# enum and the current mode of the application is stored as a private attribute [.java]#mode# in [.java]#LogicManager#. Users can switch between modes in ROR using the `{XXX}Mode` command, such as `menuMode` and `tableMode`. When the mode of the application is changed, we need to update the:

* [.java]#Logic# component so that the [.java]#mode# attribute in [.java]#LogicManager# reflects the new current mode, since this is used to check if a command can be executed,
* [.java]#UI# component so that the panels display the information that is relevant to the mode.

For all these commands, these updates are done using a new [.java]#toMode# attribute added to the [.java]#CommandResult# object. As an example, the figure below shows the sequence diagram for when a user executes the `menuMode` command:

.Component interactions for `menuMode` command
image::MenuModeSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Upon execution of the `menuMode` command, [.java]#MenuModeCommand#generateCommandResult()# will generate a [.java]#CommandResult# whose [.java]#toMode# attribute is set to [.java]#MENU_MODE# and return it to the [.java]#LogicManager#. Now, the updates can be done for the respective components:

* [.java]#Logic# component: [.java]#LogicManager# calls [.java]#CommandResult#newModeStatus()# to retrieve the mode to be changed to and updates the current mode stored in its [.java]#mode# attribute by calling [.java]#LogicManager#changeMode()#. The [.java]#CommandResult# is passed to [.java]#MainWindow# in UI.
* [.java]#UI# component: [.java]#MainWindow# calls [.java]#CommandResult#newModeStatus()# to retrieve the mode to be changed to and updates the display panels by calling [.java]#MainWindow#handleChangeMode()#.

[NOTE]
For commands that do not involve a change in mode, [.java]#CommandResult#newModeStatus()# will return [.java]#null# and no updates to the current mode or display will be done.

[[ChangeToTableMode]]
===== Changing to Table Mode for a specific table
All the commands that change modes take no parameters except for Table Mode. When the user wants to perform order-related operations (eg. add an item to the table's order), the user will first have to switch to Table Mode by typing the `tableMode` command (or its shortcut `TM`) followed by the table number of the table that the user wants to perform actions on.

The following sequence diagram shows the relevant parts of what happens when a user executes the `tableMode 3` command:

.Component interactions for `tableMode 3` command
image::TableModeSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The [.java]#Logic# and [.java]#UI# component interactions work in a similar way to the other commands that change modes and the implementation is mentioned above. The only difference is the parsing of the argument *3* into a [.java]#TableNumber# object that indicates the table number of the target table to switch to. This [.java]#TableNumber# object is stored as an attribute in [.java]#TableModeCommand#.

Let's focus on what happens to the [.java]#Model# component when [.java]#TableModeCommand#execute()# is called. The relevant parts of the sequence diagram has been extracted out and shown in the diagram below.

.Interaction between Logic and Model components for `tableMode 3` command
image::TableModeModelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

It first retrieves the [.java]#Table# in RestOrRant that corresponds to its [.java]#TableNumber# attribute.
The list of tables are stored within the [.java]#Tables# object in [.java]#RestOrRant#. The read only versions of these objects can be obtained from [.java]#Model#getRestOrRant()# and then [.java]#ReadOnlyRestOrRant#getTables()#. The desired [.java]#Table# object can then be retrieved by passing [.java]#TableNumber# into [.java]#ReadOnlyTables#getTableFromNumber()#.

The [.java]#Table# is then set as the selected table in [.java]#Model# using [.java]#Model#setSelectedTable()#. This is to keep track of the current table so that the Table Mode commands like `addToOrder` and `bill` can easily perform their operations by <<CurrentTable, getting the table from [.java]#Model#getSelectedTable()#>>.

After which, [.java]#Model#updateFilteredOrderItemList()# is called to update the filtered list such that it only contains order items ordered by the chosen table. This will then update the item list panel in the UI to display only the order items that were ordered by the chosen table.

[NOTE]
[.java]#TableModeCommand#execute()# also checks that the application is not already in Table Mode of the same table number, the table number specified is valid, and the desired table is occupied.


==== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Defining of modes
| Modes are defined using a [.java]#Mode# enum. +
- *Pros*: Easily identify incorrect modes since the set of valid modes is restricted to the enum values. +
- *Cons*: Need to create a new class in Logic, which increases coupling between Logic and UI components.

We decided to choose this option as the enum is an abstraction over the possible modes. Apart from being less prone to errors,
it also makes the code more readable as the enum values explicitly state the name of the mode (eg. [.java]#TABLE_MODE#, [.java]#MENU_MODE#) and are stored
in [.java]#Mode# variables, making it clear that it refers to a mode and not just any string.
| Modes can be defined with strings (eg. "TableMode") or integers. +
- *Pros*: Easy to implement. +
- *Cons*: May be prone to errors (eg. mistyping a string) that causes bugs in the code. +

| Storing of current mode
| Mode stored in the Logic component ([.java]#LogicManager#). +
- *Pros*: Easy to access the current mode to check whether a command is valid to execute in a particular mode. +
- *Cons*: Slightly breaks abstraction since mode is not purely related to command execution.

We decided to store the current mode in Logic because we note that most of the work that requires access to the current mode is done here, so providing a quick access will be more efficient.
The Model component does not need to know what the current mode is at all, so it would be better to keep the coupling low to facilitate integration.

| Mode stored in the Model component ([.java]#ModelManager#). +
- *Pros*: Maintains abstraction as the mode is part of the current state of the application, which is maintained by Model. +
- *Cons*: Increases coupling among the Model, Logic and UI components. +

| Specifying table number for Table Mode commands
| Table number specified only once when switching to Table Mode, then retrieved from [.java]#Model#getSelectedTable()# for future commands. +
- *Pros*: Convenient to retrieve table number without having to explicitly specify it in every command. +
- *Cons*: Commands that change modes are not standardized since the others do not have any parameters.

We decided to go ahead with this implementation as we feel that from a user's point of view, it would be more convenient to be able to just specify the table number once and then perform a series of operations afterwards. Furthermore, having to parse the table number for every command will also do more work.

| Table number specified for every command (eg. `addToOrder 3 W09 1` to add 1x W09 to table 3). +
- *Pros*: All commands that change modes are simple and similar. +
- *Cons*: Makes the commands longer to type.

|=======================================================================
// end::changemode[]

[[Tablesf]]
=== Tables feature

The Table feature allows the users to add, edit and clear tables using the commands <<AddTable,`addTable`>>, <<EditPax,`editPax`>>, <<EditSeats, `editSeats`>> and <<ClearTables, `clearTables`>> to ensure that RestOrRant reflects their physical restaurant in terms of the number of tables and each table's occupancy. Also, the Tables feature provides a quick way to look for an available table that can accommodate the specified number of customers using the <<SpaceFor, `spaceFor`>> command. All of the table details are displayed in our UI for easy reference.

// tag::tables[]
[[TablesClasses]]
==== Classes for Tables feature in Model

The Tables feature was implemented with the introduction of a new set of classes to [.java]#Model#.
A new [.java]#Tables# class encapsulates all the methods and classes related to this feature. It also contains a listener that is used to update the storage when any modification is made to the tables. The [.java]#Tables# object is stored in [.java]#RestOrRant# and it exposes a read-only interface [.java]#ReadOnlyTables# to allow the other components to retrieve table-related information while maintaining data integrity.

[.java]#Tables# contains a [.java]#UniqueTableList#, which contains a list of all the tables. Each [.java]#Table# object consists of 2 objects:

* [.java]#TableNumber# indicates the table number of the table
* [.java]#TableStatus# indicates the occupancy of the table

[.java]#Table# objects are uniquely identified by [.java]#TableNumber# as all tables in a restaurant are uniquely labelled by their table numbers.

The Tables Class Diagram below shows the relationship between the classes.

.Tables Class Diagram in the Model component
image::TablesModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

// tag::addtable[]
[[AddTable]]
==== Adding a table to ROR

The interaction between the components for this function is similar to <<AddToMenu, adding to menu>>. A key difference in function is that `addToMenu` only adds 1 menu item each time, but `addTable` allows multiple tables to be added in a single command.

Tables are stored in a list. When `addTable 4` is keyed in, the command is parsed by [.java]#AddTableCommandParser# to check if the arguments are in valid format. They are then converted into a list of [.java]#String# table statuses, which are stored in the [.java]#AddTableCommand# object returned by the parser.

When [.java]#AddTableCommand#execute()# is called, the table statuses in the [.java]#String# list are processed one by one. For each table status, a [.java]#Table# with the appropriate [.java]#TableStatus# and [.java]#TableNumber# is created and stored in the [.java]#Model#.

The [.java]#TableNumber# runs sequentially and is kept track of by the [.java]#Tables# class. This means that there users are not allowed specify the table number for their tables and hence will not in any case add duplicate tables to ROR.

// end::addtable[]

// tag::editpax[]
[[EditPax]]
==== Edit pax at a table

===== Current Implementation

The edit pax mechanism is facilitated by [.java]#UniqueTableList#. It stores all tables currently in ROR and ensures that there are no duplicated tables. Additionally, it implements [.java]#UniqueTableList#setTable(targetTable, editedTable)#, which replaces the target table in the list with the new table with the updated [.java]#TableStatus#.

This operation is exposed in the Model interface as [.java]#Model#setTable(targetTable, editedTable)#.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit pax mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. Suppose the user launches the application for the first time, the sample data has 35 tables and are stored in the [.java]#UniqueTableList# as shown below. Focus your attention on the [.java]#Table# with the orange markup as this will be our target table in this example.

image::EditPaxStateListDiagram_Before.png[width="800]

Step 2. Suppose the user decides to have 2 customers sit at table 2 and executes `editPax 2 2` command to update Table 2 with 2 customers. The `editPax` command calls [.java]#Model#setTable(targeTable, editedTable)#, causing the ROR to create a new table with the updated [.java]#TableStatus# and replace the current target table in the [.java]#UniqueTableList#. As shown below, the index of the replaced table now points to a new [.java]#Table# which is highlighted orange.

image::EditPaxStateListDiagram_After.png[width="800"]

The [.java]#Storage# detects the above change in the [.java]#UniqueTableList# and also updates itself.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit pax operation works:

image::EditPaxSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the table to be edited does not exist in the [.java]#UniqueTableList#, the application returns an error to the user rather than attempting to replace the non existent table.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::EditPaxActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Editing the tables in [.java]#UniqueTableList#
| Replace the entire table with  an updated table. +
- *Pros*: Maintains abstraction of [.java]#Table# and [.java]#TableStatus# and reduce errors from abusing the editability of [.java]#TableStatus# in [.java]#Table#. +
- *Cons*: May have efficiency issues when creating a whole new object whenever part of it needs to be changed.

We decided to choose this option because we realise that if we were to edit the tables directly, we would need a listener for each [.java]#Table# in the [.java]#UniqueTableList# to detect changes, which is not an efficient design. Furthermore, the tables can only be edited one at a time. Hence, the space efficiency issue would not be significant.
| Directly edit the [.java]#TableStatus# of the tables. +
- *Pros*: Potentially more efficient as there is no need to create new object and replace items in a list. +
- *Cons*: Breaks abstraction to a certain extent and allows future developers to abuse the object. +

|=======================================================================

// end::editpax[]

// tag::editseats[]
[[EditSeats]]
==== Edit seats at a table

The interaction between the components for this function is similar to <<EditPax, editing pax at a table>>. A key difference in function is that `editPax` changes the occupancy of the `Table` by changing the number of customers seated at the table while `editSeats` changes the number of seats at the table.

One thing to note is that the `editSeats` command can be called on not just unoccupied tables but also occupied tables. Hence, there is a different set of checks in place to ensure that the integrity of tables is intact.

An example would be, suppose `editSeats` is called on an occupied table, we do not allow the user to change the number of seats at the table to less than the current number of customers seated at the same table. Hence, if Table 1 already has 4 customers, `editSeats 1 2` would return an error.

// end::editseats[]

// tag::cleartables[]
[[ClearTables]]
==== Clear all tables in ROR

The interaction between the components for this function is similar to <<ClearOrder, clearing an order>>. The key difference is that `clearTables` requires ROR to be completely empty before the command can be successfully executed.

This means that all of the tables in ROR have to be unoccupied and this is checked in the [.java]#ClearTablesCommand#execute()# method as shown in the code snippet below.

In the method above, [.java]#Model#isRestaurantEmpty()# loops through all the tables in the [.java]#UniqueTableList# and checks if they are  occupied. Let's walk through this method to see how the main functionality of `clearTables` is implemented:

<1> It first checks if ROR already has no tables. If it does not, an error is returned as we cannot clear an empty ROR.
<2> Then, as mentioned above, it checks if ROR is completely unoccupied by using the [.java]#Model#isRestaurantEmpty()# method.
<3> Lastly, it replaces the current list of tables in [.java]#UniqueTableList# with an empty [.java]#List# which effectively removes all record of any tables from ROR.

[[SpaceFor]]
==== Getting an available table for customers

===== Current Implementation

This command's interaction with the components is very similar to <<EditPax, editing pax at a table>>. The key difference is that it searches for the best fit table automatically instead of having the table specified by the user.

This functionality uses the `spaceFor` command and is facilitated by the [.java]#Model#isOccupied(Table)# method. This method checks if the specified table has any customers seated at the table. The `spaceFor` command works like a request and takes in 1 argument specifying the number of customers to be seated in ROR.

[.java]#SpaceForCommand#execute()# is then called which searches through the [.java]#UniqueTableList# for the best fit table. In this case, the best fit [.java]#Table# is the smallest available one that can accommodate the specified number of customers. If there is more than 1 [.java]#Table# that fits those criterions, the [.java]#Table# with the smallest [.java]#TableNumber# is chosen.

[[source, java]]
----
public CommandResult execute(Mode mode, Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        Table bestFitTable = null;
        int smallestSize = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (Table table : model.getRestOrRant().getTables().getTableList()) {
            int numberOfSeats = Integer.parseInt(table.getTableStatus().getNumberOfSeats());
            if (!table.isOccupied() && numberOfSeats >= size && numberOfSeats < smallestSize) { // <1>
                bestFitTable = table;
                smallestSize = numberOfSeats;
            }
            if (smallestSize == size) { // <2>
                break;
            }
        }

        if (bestFitTable == null) { // <3>
            throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_NO_AVAILABLE_TABLE, String.valueOf(size)));
        }
        model.setTable(bestFitTable, new Table(bestFitTable.getTableNumber(),
                new TableStatus(String.valueOf(size) + "/" + bestFitTable.getTableStatus().getNumberOfSeats()))); // <4>

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, String.valueOf(size), bestFitTable.getTableNumber()));
}
----
In the method above, we loop through the tables in the [.java]#UniqueTableList# while checking for the following:

<1> It first checks if the table is occupied. If  the table is occupied, the if-statement is short circuited. If the table is not occupied, we check if the table is able to accommodate the specified number of customers.
<2> This second if statement checks if we have already found the best fit table. If we have, we can break out of the for loop to make this operation more efficient.
<3> The last if-statement checks if an available table can be found in the [.java]#UniqueTableList#. If the table is not found, an error message is thrown for the user.

The [.java]#smallestSize# attribute is meant to facilitate the search for the best fit table.

===== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Choosing the table to allocate to the customers.
| Search for the best fit table (table with the least number of seats that can accommodate the customers) +
- *Pros*: Allows the user to allocate tables in the restaurant more efficiently. +
- *Cons*: May have efficiency issues when as it is more likely to go through the all the tables in the [.java]#UniqueTableList# to search for the table.

We decided to choose this option because we realise getting the best fit table would be something that our users prefer as it allows them to run their business more efficiently.
| Select the first table that is able to accommodate the specified customers. +
- *Pros*: Potentially more efficient as it is less likely to have to go through the entire [.java]#UniqueTableList# +
- *Cons*: Brings about inefficiencies in the users' front-end operations which is what our application is designed to improve. This makes them less likely to use the command.

[[Ordersf]]
=== Orders feature

The Orders feature allows restaurant front-end staff to take orders from customers using the <<AddToOrder, `addToOrder`>> command,
as well as remove incorrectly inputted orders using the <<DeleteFromOrder, `deleteFromOrder`>> or <<ClearOrder, `clearOrder`>> commands.
They can track the current list of items ordered for each table (in Table Mode) or across all tables (in Restaurant Mode) and update their serving statuses with the <<Serve, `serve`>> command.

// tag::orders[]
[[OrdersClasses]]
==== Classes for Orders feature in Model

The Orders feature was implemented with the introduction of a new set of classes to [.java]#Model#.
A new [.java]#Orders# class encapsulates all the methods and classes related to this feature. It also contains a listener that is used to update the storage when any modification is made to the orders. The [.java]#Orders# object is stored in [.java]#RestOrRant# and it exposes a read-only interface [.java]#ReadOnlyOrders# to allow the other components to retrieve order-related information while maintaining data integrity.

[.java]#Orders# contains a [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList#, which contains a list of all the items ordered across all the tables in the restaurant, represented by [.java]#OrderItem# objects. Each [.java]#OrderItem# object consists of 4 objects:

* [.java]#TableNumber# indicates the table number of the table that ordered the item
* [.java]#OrderItemStatus# tracks the quantity ordered and the quantity that has yet to be served
* [.java]#Code# indicates the item code and is used to identify the item ordered
* [.java]#Name# indicates the item name and is used for display in the UI

[.java]#OrderItem# objects are uniquely identified by [.java]#TableNumber#, [.java]#Code# and [.java]#Name# as each table can only have one order entry for each item.

The Orders Class Diagram below shows the relationship between the classes.

.Orders Class Diagram in the Model component
image::OrdersModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

// tag::currenttable[]
[[CurrentTable]]
==== Getting the table number

The Orders feature allows users to perform order-related operations for a specific table. The table number of that table is specified when <<ChangeToTableMode, switching over to Table Mode>>.

[NOTE]
The table number is stored so that users do not need to keep specifying it when typing the commands.

As a result, all the commands in the Orders feature will have to retrieve the table number from [.java]#Model# first before they can perform their functions. The current table is stored as a [.java]#Table# object in [.java]#Model#, which is retrieved by calling [.java]#Model#getSelectedTable()#.
The table number, which is represented by a [.java]#TableNumber# object, can then be retrieved from that [.java]#Table#. The sequence diagram for this operation is shown below.

.Sequence diagram for retrieving the table number
image::CurrentTableSequenceDiagram.png[width="400"]
// end::currenttable[]
// end::orders[]

// tag::addtoorder[]
[[AddToOrder]]
==== Adding to an order

The user may want to add new order items to a specific table's order and this can be done with the `addToOrder` command.

The interaction between the components for this function is similar to <<AddToMenu, adding to menu>>. A key difference in function is that `addToMenu` only adds 1 menu item each time, but `addToOrder` allows multiple and duplicate items to be added in a single command.

Suppose the user wants to add 3 "W09 Chicken Wings" and 1 "W12 French Fries" to the order. When `addToOrder W09 3 W12 1` is keyed in, the command is parsed by [.java]#AddToOrderCommandParser# to check if the arguments are in valid format. They are then converted into a list of [.java]#Code# item codes and a list of [.java]#Integer# quantities, which are stored in the [.java]#AddToOrderCommand# object returned by the parser.

When [.java]#AddToOrderCommand#execute()# is called, the [.java]#Code# objects in the list are processed one by one. For each [.java]#Code#:

. It attempts to retrieve a [.java]#MenuItem# object that contains the given [.java]#Code# from [.java]#Model# to check if the item exists in the menu. If it does not exist, an error is returned and the subsequent item codes in the list are not processed.

. It thens attempt to find an [.java]#OrderItem# object with the given [.java]#Code# and the <<CurrentTable, current [.java]#TableNumber#>> to see if that item has already been ordered by the table. If it already exists, the quantity will be updated in the [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# using [.java]#Model#setOrderItem()#. A new [.java]#OrderItem# with a new [.java]#OrderItemStatus# will be created to replace the existing one. Otherwise, a new [.java]#OrderItem# will be added to the [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# using [.java]#Model#addOrderItem()#.

// end::addtoorder[]

// tag::deletefromorder[]

[[DeleteFromOrder]]
==== Deleting from an order

The user may want to remove an order item from a specific table's order and this can be done with the `deleteFromOrder` command.

The interaction between the components for this function is similar to <<DeleteFromMenu, deleting from menu>>.

Suppose the user wants to delete "W09 Chicken Wings" from the order. When `deleteFromOrder W09` is keyed in, the command is parsed by [.java]#DeleteFromOrderCommandParser# to check if the item code is in valid format. It is then converted into a [.java]#Code# object which is stored in the [.java]#DeleteFromOrderCommand# object returned by the parser.

When [.java]#DeleteFromOrderCommand#execute()# is called, it will use the [.java]#Code# to check whether the item exists in the menu and whether the current table has ordered the item.
If the [.java]#OrderItem# is found, it will be deleted from the [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# using [.java]#Model#deleteOrderItem()#.

// end::deletefromorder[]

// tag::clearorder[]
[[ClearOrder]]
==== Clearing an order

The user may want to remove all the order items from a specific table's order and this can be done with the `clearOrder` command.

===== Current Implementation

When the user enters the `clearOrder` command, the command is parsed and a [.java]#ClearOrderCommand# object is created.

[.java]#ClearOrderCommand#execute()# is then called, which in turn calls [.java]#Model#clearOrderItemsFrom()# with the <<CurrentTable, current TableNumber>>.
[.java]#Model# acts as a facade and forwards the call to [.java]#Orders#clearOrderItemsFrom()#, and that method's source code is replicated below.

[source, java]
----
public void clearOrderItemsFrom(TableNumber tableNumber) {
        ArrayList<OrderItem> itemsToDelete = new ArrayList<>();
        for (OrderItem orderItem : orderItems) { // <1>
            if (orderItem.getTableNumber().equals(tableNumber)) {
                itemsToDelete.add(orderItem);
            }
        }
        for (OrderItem item : itemsToDelete) { // <2>
            orderItems.remove(item);
        }
        indicateModified(); // <3>
}
----

In the method above, [.java]#orderItems# is a [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# that contains all the order items from all the tables. Let's walk through this method to see how the main functionality of `clearOrder` is implemented:

<1> It first loops through all the items in the [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# and stores the [.java]#OrderItem# objects with the current [.java]#TableNumber# into a new list.
<2> It then deletes the items in this list from the [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList#.
<3> Finally, it triggers the listener in [.java]#Orders# to indicate that the order item list has been modified. This signals to the [.java]#LogicManager# to update the storage data files by calling [.java]#Storage#saveOrders()#.

The sequence diagram for when a user executes the `clearOrder` command is shown below.

.Component interactions for `clearOrder` command
image::ClearOrderSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Storing of order items
| The order items from all the tables in RestOrRant can be stored in a single [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList#. +
- *Pros*: Easier to handle a single list. +
- *Cons*: `clearOrder` needs to iterate through the entire list to delete the order items from the specific table.

We decided to choose this option because we realise that customers are unlikely to order a large number of items in a single table, so it would not be space efficient to create so many [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList#.
Furthermore, it also provides the benefit of arranging the order items across all the tables based on when they were ordered without keeping an extra time attribute. This provides the useful functionality of seeing which orders should be fulfilled first in Restaurant Mode.
| Each table has its own [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# to store the order items for that table. +
- *Pros*: `clearOrder` will just need to create a new empty [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# to replace the existing one. +
- *Cons*: Difficult to keep track of so many lists. May be space inefficient to create multiple [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# if each list only has a few items. +

|=======================================================================
// end::clearorder[]

// tag::serve[]
[[Serve]]
==== Serving items in an order

The user may want to mark order items from a specific table's order as served and this can be done with the `serve` command.

The interaction between the components for this function is similar to <<EditPax, editing the occupancy of a table>>.

Suppose 3 "W09 Chicken Wings" have been ordered by the table and the user wants to mark 2 of them as served. When `serve W09 2` is keyed in, the command is parsed by [.java]#ServeCommandParser# to check if the arguments are in valid format. The valid [.java]#Code# item code and [.java]#Integer# quantity are then stored in the [.java]#ServeCommand# object returned by the parser.

When [.java]#ServeCommand#execute()# is called, it will use the [.java]#Code# to check whether the item exists in the menu and whether the current table has ordered the item.
If the [.java]#OrderItem# is found and the quantity served is valid, a new [.java]#OrderItem# object will be created with a new [.java]#OrderItemStatus# that reflects the new quantities.
[.java]#Model#setOrderItem()# is then used to replace the old [.java]#OrderItem# object in the [.java]#UniqueOrderItemList# with the new one.

// end::serve[]

[[Menuf]]
=== Menu feature
The Menu feature allows restaurant managers to take add items to the menu using the <<AddToMenu, `addToMenu`>> command, as well as
remove menu items as needed using the <<DeleteFromMenu, `deleteFromMenu`>> or <<ClearMenu, `clearMenu`>> commands. They can track the current list of
available items in the menu (with the UI displays in Table Mode and Menu Mode).

This feature works in support of

* Orders feature: Adding and removing items from the menu would in turn affect items to be ordered.
* Statistics feature: Popular menu items are listed in descending order of quantities ordered. This is supported by storing the quantities ordered in the json file and internally updating it when orders are confirmed.

// tag::menu[]
[[MenuClasses]]
==== Classes for Menu feature in Model

The Menu feature was implemented with the introduction of a new set of classes to [.java]#Model#. A new [.java]#Menu# class encapsulates all the methods and classes related to this feature. It also contains a listener that is used to update the storage when any modification is made to the orders. The [.java]#Menu# object is stored in [.java]#RestOrRant# and it exposes a read-only interface [.java]#ReadOnlyMenu# to allow the other components to retrieve menu-related information while maintaining data integrity.

[.java]#Menu# contains a [.java]#UniqueMenuItemList#, which contains a list of all the items in the menu, represented by [.java]#MenuItem# objects. Each [.java]#MenuItem# object consists of 3 objects:

* [.java]#Name# indicates the item name and is used for display in the UI
* [.java]#Code# indicates the item code and is used to identify the menu item
* [.java]#Price# indicates the item price and is used for display in the UI and calculation of bill

[.java]#MenuItem# objects are uniquely identified by [.java]#Code#. As such, each menu item should have distinct item codes.

The Menu Class Diagram below shows the relationship between the classes.

.Menu Class Diagram in the Model component
image::MenuModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::menu[]

// tag::addtomenu[]
[[AddToMenu]]
==== Adding to menu

The user may want to add new menu items to the menu and this can be done with the `addToMenu` command.

===== Current Implementation

The menu items in the menu are stored as a list. Adding a new menu item to the menu is done by adding to the existing list.

The command is read as a text string from the command box in the UI and then is executed by calling [.java]#MainWindow#executeCommand()#, which passes this string to the [.java]#Logic# component by calling [.java]#Logic#execute()#.

The sequence diagram for interactions between the [.java]#Logic#, [.java]#Model# and [.java]#Storage# components when a user executes the `addToMenu` command is shown below.

.Component interactions for `addToMenu` command
image::AddToMenuSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The [.java]#Logic#execute()# method then creates a command from the text string input
 by parsing the string to identify the command word (done by the [.java]#RestOrRantParser#parse()# method) and other parameters, in this case the attributes of the [.java]#MenuItem# (done by the [.java]#AddToMenuCommandParser#parse()# method, omitted from the sequence diagram). After parsing, the text string is then converted to [.java]#Name#, [.java]#Code#, and [.java]#Price# and a new [.java]#MenuItem# is created with these attributes and then passed to [.java]#Model# component.

In the [.java]#Model# component, firstly the validity of the [.java]#Name#, [.java]#Code# and [.java]#Price# of the [.java]#MenuItem# is checked. The three attributes must follow the specified format for them to be valid. The [.java]#MenuItem# is only added to the [.java]#UniqueMenuItemList# after ensuring that the same menu item does not already exist in the list. For this to be true, the new menu item should not have the same [.java]#Code# as any other  item in the list.

After adding to the list in the [.java]#Model# component, the [.java]#Menu#indicateModified()# method is called, which then triggers the Logic component to save the state of the menu, by calling [.java]#Storage#saveMenu()#.

The User Interface also updated by adding the new menu item to the list panel.

[NOTE]
This action can only be done in Menu Mode. If not in Menu Mode currently, users can first change mode by <<ChangingModes, switching over to Menu Mode>>.

===== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Saving changes from addition of menu items
| Save only the menu, using the [.java]#Menu#indicateModified()# and [.java]#Storage#saveMenu()# methods. +
- *Pros*: Uses less memory as any update to the menu will only save the menu. +
- *Cons*: An increase in the number of variables during runtime, as every feature will need a listener and a boolean (for instance, menu feature would have a listener and a boolean [.java]#menuModified# to call [.java]#Storage#saveMenu()# when the boolean evaluates to true).

We decided to choose this option because we realise that there would be bigger performance issues such as lagging in
the long run if we were to save every instance of the restaurant for every update to each feature.
| Save the whole restaurant instance, by just having two methods ([.java]#RestOrRant#indicateModified()# and [.java]#Storage#saveRestOrRant()#) overall. +
- *Pros*: Fewer variables during runtime, easier to call just one boolean upon any change to restaurant features. +
- *Cons*: There is no need to save another feature if only menu is being updated, may cause lagging instead of improving performance. +

|=======================================================================
// end::addtomenu[]

// tag::deletefrommenu[]
[[DeleteFromMenu]]
==== Deleting from menu

The user may want to remove a menu item from the menu and this can be done using the `deleteFromMenu` command.

===== Current Implementation

As mentioned above, deleting a menu item from the menu is done by removing from the existing list.

The interactions between all four components when a user executes the `deleteFromMenu` command is very similar to the interactions when <<AddToMenu, adding to menu>>:

One specific difference is that deleting from menu only requires item [.java]#Code#, whereas adding to menu requires [.java]#Name#, [.java]#Code# and [.java]#Price#. For this reason, we have decided to not use any prefixes (such as `c/` to denote item code).

After parsing the input text string by the [.java]#RestOrRantParser#parse()# method, the [.java]#DeleteFromMenuCommand# object is created.

[.java]#DeleteFromMenuCommand# then makes use of the method [.java]#Menu#getItemFromCode()# to retrieve the menu item from the item [.java]#Code# input. The code snippet of the method is shown below:

[source, java]
----
public Optional<MenuItem> getItemFromCode(Code code) {
    Iterator<MenuItem> iterator = menuItems.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) { <1>
        MenuItem menuItem = iterator.next();
        if (menuItem.getCode().equals(code)) {
            return Optional.of(menuItem); <2>
        }
    }
    return Optional.empty(); <3>
}
----

The [.java]#MenuItem# is retrieved from the [.java]#Code# by searching through the [.java]#UniqueMenuItemList#, called [.java]#menuItems# in this snippet. [.java]#Optional# is used as a means of defensive programming so that a null [.java]#Code# would not result in a null pointer exception but would be safely handled by showing an error message to the user for incorrect [.java]#Code# input.

<1> The method first loops through all items in the list.
<2> If a [.java]#MenuItem# with the same code is found, it is returned as an [.java]#Optional#.
<3> If no such [.java]#MenuItem# is found, an [.java]#Optional.empty()# is returned, to safely handle nulls.

The retrieved [.java]#MenuItem# is then passed to Model component to be removed from the [.java]#UniqueMenuItemList#.

Similar to adding to the menu, after removing from the list in the [.java]#Model# component, the [.java]#Menu#indicateModified()# method is called, which then triggers the Logic component to save the state of the menu, by calling [.java]#Storage#saveMenu()#.

The User Interface is also updated by removing the menu item on the list panel.

[NOTE]
This action can only be done in Menu Mode. If not in Menu Mode currently, users can first change mode by <<ChangingModes, switching over to Menu Mode>>.

===== Design Considerations
The above design considerations under <<AddToMenu, Adding to Menu>> on saving changes to the menu also holds when deleting menu items.

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Retrieving the [.java]#MenuItem# from the [.java]#Code#
| Handle this operation with the already existing [.java]#UniqueMenuItemList#. +
- *Pros*: Uses less memory as using another data structure would take up twice the space, since [
.java]#UniqueMenuItemList# is required for ease of implementations of display in the UI. +
- *Cons*: Takes more time to loop through all menu items in the [.java]#UniqueMenuItemList#, especially if the list
is extensive.

We decided to choose this option because we realise that the system would be able to support a typical restaurant's
menu with close to no lagging, and chose to optimise memory over speed.
| Create a new HashTable to map item codes to menu items, and search through this HashTable to retrieve the item. +
- *Pros*: Less time taken to search in HashTable than in List. +
- *Cons*: Uses more memory as all menu items will be saved in two data structures. Moreover, there is a need to
reflect any changes to the menu in both of the data structures. +
|=======================================================================
// end::deletefrommenu[]

// tag::clearmenu[]
[[ClearMenu]]
==== Clearing the menu

The user may want to remove all the menu items from the menu and this can be done with the `clearMenu` command.

The interaction between the components for this function is similar to <<ClearOrder, clearing an order>>. A small difference is that `clearMenu` clears all menu items, while `clearOrder` only clears orders within a specific table.

When `clearMenu` is keyed in, the command is parsed by [.java]#RestOrRantParser# and a [.java]#ClearMenuCommand# object is returned by the parser.

When [.java]#ClearMenuCommand#execute()# is called, it will check if the restaurant is occupied, and if the menu is empty. [.java]#CommandException# with respective error messages will be thrown if either of the conditions are true. After ensuring that the restaurant is unoccupied and the menu is non-empty, the menu will be cleared by initializing the menu with an empty [.java]#ArrayList#, with the [.java]#Model#setMenuItems()# method.

// end::clearmenu[]

// tag::statistics[]
// tag::statisticsintro[]
[[Statistics]]
[[Statisticsf]]
=== Statistics feature

The Statistics feature allows users to perform queries that deal with the restaurant's statistical data, mainly the
revenue earned and the popularity of menu items. With Statistics feature, restaurant front-end staffs can bill the
customers' orders and automatically save the revenue in the restaurant's statistics storage using the <<Bill, `bill`>>
 command.
Other commands like <<Trends, `yearly`>>, <<Trends, `monthly`>>, <<Trends, `daily`>> and <<Revenue, `revenue`>>
commands allow the manager to retrieve and study the restaurant's statistical data trends. +
// end::statisticsintro[]
// tag::statisticsclasses[]
[[StatsClasses]]
==== Classes for Statistics feature in Model

The Statistics feature was implemented with the introduction of a new set of classes to [.java]#Model#.
A new [.java]#Statistics# class encapsulates all the methods and classes related to this feature. It also contains a
listener that is used to update the storage when any modification is made to the statistics. The [.java]#Statistics#
object is stored in [.java]#RestOrRant# and it exposes a read-only interface [.java]#ReadOnlyStatistics# to allow the
other components to retrieve statistics-related information while maintaining data integrity.

[.java]#Statistics# contains a [.java]#RevenueList#, which contains a list of all the revenue recorded in the
restaurant, represented by [.java]#Revenue# objects. Each [.java]#Revenue# object consists of 3 objects:

* [.java]#Year# indicates the year which the revenue was earned
* [.java]#Month# indicates the month which the revenue was earned
* [.java]#Day# indicates the day which the revenue was earned

[.java]#YearlyRevenue#, [.java]#MonthlyRevenue# and  [.java]#DailyRevenue# are classes that extends [.java]#Revenue# to inherit its properties.
Hence, they are all uniquely identified by [.java]#Year#, [.java]#Month# and [.java]#Day#.
Similarly, [.java]#Date# and [.java]#Bill# also consists and are identified by the above 3 objects.

The Statistics Class Diagram below shows the relationship between the classes.

// end::statisticsclasses[]
// tag::statisticsstorage[]
[[StatsStorage]]
==== Design Considerations for Statistics Storage

The data stored in [.java]#Storage# (/data/statistics.json) only encompasses Day, Month, Year and Revenue earned on
that specific date. These data are stored when the <<Bill, `bill`>> command is called.

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Storage of statistical data
| Stores daily revenue which comprises of day, month, year and revenue. +
- *Pros*: Less storage space used. +
- *Cons*: No record of bill. Impossible to retrieve receipts. +

In a restaurant, it is unlikely that a customer will request for a refund after consuming and paying for the meal.
Even if there are complaints about the meal, they will demand for a newly cooked dish before calling for the bill.
Hence, we did not see the need to store receipts in the storage and chose this design.

|Stores bill which comprises of the day, month, year, bill, table number and receipt. +
- *Pros*: Able to retrieve data of bills. +
- *Cons*: More storage space for lists of bills for each day.
|=======================================================================

// end::statisticsstorage[]

// tag::bill[]
[[Bill]]
==== Billing an order

Each [.java]#Bill# is unique to a Table. Hence, the `bill` mechanism can only be executed under Table Mode.
 The [.java]#Table# and its [.java]#TableNumber# was specified when <<ChangeToTableMode, switching over to Table Mode>>.
  The way [.java]#TableNumber# is specified is <<CurrentTable, explained in Orders feature>>.

Once the `bill` command is called, it will internally switch to <<BillMode, Bill Mode>> where the receipt of
 the specified table is displayed. Concurrently, the bill mechanism accesses functions from [.java]#Tables#, [.java]#Orders#, [.java]#Menu# and
 [.java]#Statistics# to execute the following:

* *Table*: Updates specified table's occupancy to accommodate new customers.
* *Order*: Clears the order list that belongs to the specified table.
* *Menu*: Saves the quantity of menu items ordered in the Menu storage (/data/menu.json).
* *Statistics*: Saves the revenue in the Statistics Storage (/data/statistics.json).

===== Current Implementation

The main crux of Bill mechanism is implemented in [.java]#BillCommand#. Just like any other commands, [
.java]#BillCommand#execute()# overrides
[.java]#Command#execute()# which is called in [.java]#LogicManager#. It takes in the current mode, model and command
history which will provide the necessary functions it will need to execute the command properly with the following
operations:

* [.java]#BillCommand#calculateBill()# -- Creates a bill with a receipt of all menu items ordered and updates the
 quantity of menu items ordered in [.java]#Menu#menuItems#.
* [.java]#BillCommand#createOrUpdateRevenue()# -- Either saves the bill as a new [.java]#DailyRevenue# or updates an
existing [.java]#Revenue# in the [.java]#Statistics#revenueList#.
* [.java]#BillCommand#updateStatusOfTable()# -- Updates the occupancy of the specified table to indicate that it has
zero customers and resets the selected table to null.
* [.java]#Model#clearOrderItemsFrom()# -- Clears the order list to prepare for the next customer.

This sequence diagram provides an overview of how the operations above work together to execute `bill` command.

.Sequence diagram for executing the `bill` command
image::Bill_SequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

To give you a better understanding of the sequence diagram, the following is a usage scenario and how the bill
mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1.*
Let's assume that the user is in Table Mode 1. This means Table 1 is the selected table. Before the
`bill` command can be executed successfully, [.java]#BillCommand#execute()# conducts 2 checks. +

1. Checks that current table obtained from [.java]#Model#getSelectedTable()# exists.
2. Checks that all order items in [
.java]#Model#getFilteredOrderItemList()# have been served. The status of the order item is determined via [.java]#Model#getOrderItemStatus()#.

*Step 2.*
Given that the command passes all checks, the user can successfully run [
.java]#BillCommand#calculateBill()# to assign a new calculated bill to the [.java]#tableToBill# attribute. Let's
refer to the function's sequence diagram below.

.Sequence diagram for calculating the bill
image::Bill_CalculateBill.png[width="800"]

[.java]#BillCommand#calculateBill()# calls both [.java]#Model#getFilteredOrderItemList()# and [
.java]#ReadOnlyRestOrRant#getMenu()# to obtain the table’s list of orders and the restaurant’s menu.
After which, it iterates through the list of orders to obtain individual [.java]#OrderItem# and
executes the following in each iteration:

* Gets [.java]#MenuItem# by passing the code of the [.java]#OrderItem# into [.java]#Menu#getItemFromCode()#.
* Retrieves the quantity of [.java]#OrderItem# ordered using [.java]#OrderItem#getQuantityOrdered()#.
* Updates the quantity of menu item ordered using [.java]#ReadOnlyMenu#updateMenuItemQuantity()#.
* Creates a [.java]#receipt# that appends the [.java]#MenuItem#getCode()#, [.java]#MenuItem#getName()#, [
.java]#MenuItem#getPrice()# and the quantity retrieved previously.
* Adds the price of each [.java]#MenuItem# multiplied by the quantity ordered to the total bill.

After iterating through the list of orders, [.java]#receipt# appends the final calculation of the total
bill and the function returns a new [.java]#Bill# that contains the updated [.java]#tableNumber#, [.java]#totalBill# and
[.java]#receipt#. This new [.java]#Bill# will be assigned to the [.java]#bill# attribute and passed into [
.java]#Model#setRecentBill()# to update the Model's recent bill (This step is needed when changing the user interface to Bill Mode).

Now that [.java]#bill# is updated, it is passed into [.java]#BillCommand#createOrUpdateRevenue()# to store the calculated bill in [.java]#Statistics#revenueList#. Refer to the function's sequence diagram below.

.Sequence diagram for creating or updating revenue in the Statistics revenue list
image::Bill_CreateOrUpdateRevenue.png[width="700"]

As shown above, [.java]#BillCommand#createOrUpdateRevenue()# creates a [.java]#DailyRevenue# with the bill's year, month and day.
 It checks if the newly created [.java]#DailyRevenue# exists in the [.java]#revenueList# via [.java]#Model#hasRevenue()#.
If it is true that [.java]#DailyRevenue# exists, the function iterates through the [
.java]#Model#getFilteredRevenueList()# and searches for a an existing [.java]#Revenue# that has the same year, month and
day as the [.java]#DailyRevenue#. Once the [.java]#Revenue# is found, [.java]#Revenue#addToRevenue()# is used to add the
 total bill of the [.java]#DailyRevenue# into [.java]#Revenue#. Otherwise, the [.java]#DailyRevenue# is added into
  the [.java]#revenueList# via [.java]#Model#addRevenue()#.

Now, that the necessary data are updated in the internal list of Menu and Statistics, [.java]#BillCommand#execute()#
calls [
.java]#BillCommand#updateStatusOfTable()# and  [.java]#Model#clearOrderItemsFrom()# to make the table available for
new customers.

.Sequence diagram for updating the status of the table
image::Bill_UpdateStatusOfTable.png[width="700"]

[.java]#BillCommand#updateStatusOfTable()# updates the table status by creating a new [.java]#Table# with an updated
[.java]#TableStatus# and replace the existing [.java]#Table# with the new one. After the table is updated, the program
 sets the selected table to null to indicate that the table is no longer in use.

Once these essential functions are executed, [.java]#BillCommand#execute()# moves on to indicate that the
Tables, Orders, Menu and Statistics data have been modified via [.java]#Model#updateTables()#, [
.java]#Model#updateOrders()#, [.java]#Model#updateMenu()#, [.java]#Model#updateStatistics()#. After which it returns
the [.java]#CommandResult# to [.java]#LogicManager#excute()# where the it will check if the Tables, Orders, Menu
and Statistics data have been modified and updates the storage accordingly. The same [.java]#CommandResult# is
returned to [.java]#MainWindow#executeCommand()# where the user interface switches to Bill Mode to display the
receipt of the recent [.java]#Bill#.

[NOTE]
Internally the program switches to Bill Mode. However, this mode is shown to the user as Table Mode to avoid
confusion.

===== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Design calculateBill()
| Iterates through the [.java]#FilteredOrderItemList# once to append the receipt, update quantity ordered of
the items in [.java]#Menu# and calculate the bill. +
- *Pros*: Efficient as it only iterates through the list once. +
- *Cons*: The code can be further break into different functions. +

We chose this design to prioritize efficiency in this use case. Since `bill` command is only
called when the customer is ready to pay and leave the restaurant, it is better for the payment process to
be swift.

| Create different functions that specifically calculates the bill, creates a bill receipt and update the quantity of
 menu items ordered. +
- *Pros*: Adheres to a better abstract design of the code. +
- *Cons*: Inefficient due to multiple iteration of the [.java]#FilteredOrderItemList#. Given a long list of order
items, this design will be impractical. +
|=======================================================================

// tag::trends[]
[[Trends]]
==== Changing Statistics Mode display
The following implementation applies for `yearly`, `monthly` and `daily` commands.
These commands make adjustments to the user interface to display statistical data trends.

===== Current Implementation

The execution of these commands is similar to <<ChangeMode, changing the mode>>. The only difference is that [
.java]#isYearly#, [.java]#isMonthly# and [.java]#isDaily# boolean variables are used in [
.java]#MainWindow#executeCommand()#. These boolean variables are passed into [.java]#MainWindow#handleChangeMode()#
where it will determine which display to switch to. You may refer to the activity diagram to understand the cause of
actions in the Statistics Mode user interface.

.Statistics Mode Display Activity Diagram
image::Trend_ActivityDiagram.png[]

Since these commands changes the user interface, a huge portion of their mechanism is dependent on [
.java]#StatisticsFlowPanel#. It determines the layout and arrangement of the revenue cards displayed.

Once the revenue observable list and boolean variables are passed into [.java]#StatisticsFlowPanel#, the function
checks which boolean variable is true. Lets assume that [.java]#isDaily# is true for `daily` command. The function
enters a while loop that iterates through the revenue list until at most 30 [.java]#DailyRevenue# objects are created
and added to a list of [.java]#DailyRevenue#.

[NOTE]
The list of [.java]#DailyRevenue# generated is sorted in a reverse chronological order of the date.
Hence, even if there are no revenue recorded on a specific date, a [.java]#DailyRevenue# object is still created and added to
the list.

After which, the list of [.java]#DailyRevenue# is iterated to generate [.java]#DailyStatisticsCard# for each [
.java]#DailyRevenue#. These [.java]#DailyStatisticsCard# are added to the [
.java]#StatisticsFlowPanel#statisticsFlowPane# to update the user interface.

===== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Arrangement of [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# +
| [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# are arranged in descending order. +
- *Pros*: The most recent card is visible to the user without scrolling. +
- *Cons*: Viewing dates in a descending order might make it difficult to study trends. +

| [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# are arranged in ascending order. +
- *Pros*: Provides a sense of familiarity as the order is similar to that of a calendar. +
- *Cons*: Users have to scroll to the end to view the latest revenue. +

| Limit the number of [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# +
| Maximum [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# shown is 30. +
- *Pros*: Prevents overflow of data. No longer have to scroll through multiple [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# +
- *Cons*: Cannot view revenue from the other dates. +

| Display all [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# created from stored revenue data. +
- *Pros*: All revenue is available in a single page. +
- *Cons*: Might experience overflow of data in the user interface. User might have to scroll to the revenue +

| Create additional [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# with $0 revenue +
| Display all [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# in chronological order. +
- *Pros*: Gives user a bigger picture of the restaurant's recent earning trends. +
- *Cons*: Takes up space. It might be unnecessary information to the user. +

| Only display all [.java]#[XXX]StatisticsCard# created from stored revenue data. +
- *Pros*: More revenue figures are presented to the user. +
- *Cons*: Might appear too cluttered making it difficult to study revenue trends. +
|=======================================================================

The current implementation uses the designs in Alternative 1. However, in version 2.0, the application will take the
pros of Alternative 2 designs and incorporate them to the current implementation. To help users better study the
revenue trends, v2.0 will allow users to call the commands with an argument that indicates the month or year that they want.
The display will arrange the [.java]#DailyStatisticsCard# in a calender view with 7 columns for each day. A limit
of 31 [.java]#DailyStatisticsCard# will be used to replicate a calendar and prevent overflowing.

// end::trends[]

// tag::revenue[]
[[Revenue]]
==== Getting the revenue

===== Current Implementation

When the user enters the `revenue` command, the command is parsed and a [.java]#RevenueCommand# object is created.

[.java]#RevenueCommand#execute()# is then called, which in turn calls [.java]#Model#getFilteredRevenueList()# to
obtain the list of revenue stored in the Storage. To create convenience and efficiency in the execution of the
`revenue` command, 4 different types of argument combinations are provided for the users to obtain the desired revenue.
The diagram below illustrates the internal flow of actions for different argument inputs.

.Revenue Internal Flow Diagram
image::Revenue_ActivityDiagram.png[]

The above diagram summarizes the overall implementation of [.java]#RevenueCommand#. Depending on the user input, the function creates a new [.java]#Revenue# object and iterates through the revenue list to search for revenue of
the same year, month or day. If the revenue is the same as the new [.java]#Revenue#, its total revenue is added to the
new [.java]#Revenue#. After which, the new [.java]#Revenue# object is used to generate the [.java]#CommandResult# output
string where the calculated figure will be returned.

===== Design Considerations

[width="90%",cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| Validation regex of Month and Day
| Allow single and double digits. +
- *Pros*: Users type less, providing convenience. +

Since the user input will eventually be parsed as an integer during its validation check, there is no need to
restrict the day and month inputs to 2 digits.

|Restricts to double digit  +
- *Pros*: Easier to store and present date in a standardize format like 01-Jan-2000 rather than 1-Jan-2000. +
- *Cons*: User has to type more. +

| Validation regex of Year
| Only allow four digits that are greater than 2000. +
- *Pros*: Specific restrictions prevents the possibility of making nonsensical typos. +
- *Cons*: Less flexibility. +

Since this application is catered to existing restaurants with messy front-end management, there is no need to accept
 dates that are way before the 2000s.

|No restrictions  +
- *Pros*: Type less. +
- *Cons*: Users have more freedom to make queries that are not beneficial to them. +

| Switch case versus Array
| Store months in string format in an Array +
- *Pros*: Efficient and fast. +
- *Cons*: Uses more temporary storage. +

We chose this design as it not only reduces the lines of code, but also efficiently obtains the needed string.

| Switch case +
- *Pros*: Use less temporary storage. +
- *Cons*: Checks through every case if it only passes the last case. +

=== Logging

We are using [.java]#java.util.logging# package for logging. The [.java]#LogsCenter# class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the [.java]#logLevel# setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The [.java]#Logger# for a class can be obtained using [.java]#LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)# which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: *Console* and to a *.log* file.

*Logging Levels*

* [.java]#SEVERE# : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* [.java]#WARNING# : Can continue, but with caution
* [.java]#INFO# : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* [.java]#FINE# : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: [.java]#config.json#).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render *.adoc* files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your *.adoc* files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the [.java]#docs/# directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the [.java]#build/docs# folder, right click on them and select menu:Open with[Google Chrome].
.  Within Chrome, click on the btn:[Print] option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to btn:[Save as PDF], then click btn:[Save] to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/stylesheets[[.java]#docs/stylesheets#] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/templates[[.java]#docs/templates#] controls the rendering of *.adoc* files
into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/templates[[.java]#docs/templates#] requires some
knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the [.java]#src/test/java# folder and choose btn:[Run 'All Tests']
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose btn:[Run 'ABC']

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the [.java]#systemtests# package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in [.java]#seedu.address.ui# package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. [.java]#seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest#
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. [.java]#seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest#
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. [.java]#seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest#


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: [.java]#HelpWindowTest# fails with a [.java]#NullPointerException#.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, [.java]#HelpWindow.html# in [.java]#src/main/resources/docs# is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[[.java]#MainApp.java#].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. *v0.1*
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, RestOrRant depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage the front-end operations of a restaurant (customers, orders, menu)
* still uses outdated front-end restaurant management systems like pen and paper
* wants to easily keep track of restaurant statistics (revenue, dishes’ popularity)
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: RestOrRant manages the customers, orders, menu and restaurant statistics with a speed faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven application. This allows the user to have a clear idea of the current status of the restaurant without the need to physically check out the space. This is especially useful for busy restaurants with unorganised or slow front-end management systems.
