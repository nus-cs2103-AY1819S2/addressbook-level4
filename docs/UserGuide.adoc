== Introduction

*Know-It-All* is a flashcard application that helps users store and organise their learning material. With an easy to use interface and a storage solution that supports content sharing, *Know-It-All* is designed to help students perform rote learning more efficiently. From cramming in between lessons to focused study, the in-built test session boosts the effectiveness of repetition and recall for memorisation. *Know-It-All* targets medicine students in NUS as their studies involve a considerable amount of memory work, and deals with content that is suitable for the bite-sized flashcard format.

== About

Welcome to the *Know-It-All* User Guide! This document will equip you with what you need in order to use `v1.4` of the application. While some familiarity with command line programs will come in handy, simply adhere to the command formats specified in this guide closely and the rest will be a breeze.  Head over to <<Quick Start>> to get started.

== Quick Start

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Commands are written in monospaced font, e.g. `sort`
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `addfolder FOLDER_NAME`, `FOLDER_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add Human Anatomy`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g HINTS in `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [h/HINTS]`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` is also acceptable.
====

=== Card Operations
Commands listed in this section affect the <<flashcard, flashcards>> within a single <<folder, folder>>.

[NOTE]
The commands in this section can only be executed when the user is within a folder

==== Adding a flashcard : `add`

Format **(Single answer)**: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [h/HINT]` +
Format **(MCQ)**: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [i/INCORRECT_OPTION]... [h/HINT]`

====
* A card can have at most 1 hint (including 0)
* A card can have any number of incorrect options to denote an MCQ card

* `add q/What is the powerhouse of the cell? a/mitochondria i/cell wall i/nucleus h/biology`


==== Editing a flashcard : `edit`

Edits the flashcard specified by the <<index, index>> in the current folder.

Format: `edit i/INDEX [q/QUESTION] [a/ANSWER] [h/HINT]`

====
* Edits the card at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed card list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* **(MCQ cards)** When editing incorrect options, the existing incorrect options of the card will be removed i.e adding of options is not cumulative.
* You can remove the card's hint by typing `h/` without specifying any hint after it.
====

Examples:

* `edit 1 a/Skin h/` +
Edits the answer of the 1st card to be 'Skin' and removes the hint associated, if any.
* `edit 2 h/history q/Who discovered Penicillin? a/Alexander Fleming` +

Format: `select INDEX`

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd card in the current folder

==== Deleting a flashcard : `delete`

Deletes the flashcard identified by index from the current folder.

Format: `delete INDEX`

====
* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed card list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
====

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd card in the address book.

==== Sort flashcards by score within a folder : `sort`

Displays all flashcards sorted such that the lowest scoring cards are at the top temporarily.

Format: `sort`

==== List flashcards : `list`

Display a list of the flashcards in the current folder, where only questions can be seen, answers are hidden.

Format: `list`

====
* This command is implicitly invoked upon entering a folder, and can be used to reset the view after search or sort.
====

==== Report user performance for folder : `report`

Displays user performance in a fullscreen for the current card folder.

Format: `report`

==== Exit folder : `change ..`

Return to the root directory (exit the current folder). Side panel on the left will display the list of folders.

Format: `change ..`

Examples:

* `change 2` +
`change ..` +
The first command enters the second folder in the folder list on the <<homedirectory, home directory>>. The second command then returns the user back to the home directory by exiting the folder.

=== Folder Operations
Commands listed in this section affect the application and not a single folder.

[NOTE]
The commands in this section can only be executed when the user is at the home directory, outside of any folder

==== Create new folder : `addfolder`

Creates a new flashcard folder with the specified name.

Format: `addfolder FOLDER_NAME`

====
* The newly created folder will not contain any cards.
* Folder names must be unique. Attempting to add a folder with the same name as an existing folder will result in an error.
* Each folder and its cards are stored independently in the directory specified in `preferences.json`. By default, this is the `data/` directory.
====

Examples:

* `addfolder Nervous System` +
Creates a folder with the name "Nervous System". The user can then enter the folder with the `change` command and begin adding cards.

==== Remove folder : `deletefolder`

Removes the flashcard folder specified by index.

Format: `deletefolder FOLDER_INDEX`

====
* When a folder is deleted, all its cards are removed as well.
====

Examples:

* `deletefolder 2` +

==== Enter folder : `change`

Enters the folder specified by index. Side panel on the left will display the list of cards in that folder.

Format: `change FOLDER_INDEX`

Examples:

* `change 2` +
Enters the second folder in the folder list on the home directory.

**Merge folders feature** `Coming in v2.0`

This feature will enable users to join multiple folders together, reducing the number of folders and grouping two topics.

Format: `merge FOLDER_INDEX_1 FOLDER_INDEX_1 NEW_FOLDER_NAME`

=== Test Operations
After memorising the content of the flashcards, it is helpful to test how much information have been internalised and retained in a timed setting. The following commands show just how this can be done with the <<testsession, Test Session>> functionality of *Know-It-All*.

==== Test flashcards in a folder : `test`

This command begins a test session, where the display area enters a fullscreen (see Figure 1 below).

.A successful test command will display a test session page
image::startTestSessionPage.png[width="790"]

Format: `test`

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid when inside the folder to be tested and is not already inside a test session.

====
* Only questions and hints are presented and users are required to either input an attempt or enter the command to
reveal the answer.
* Internally, flashcards in a folder are queued to be displayed one by one in the order of lowest existing score to highest existing score.
* The next card will only be presented when the next command is carried out.
====


Examples:

* `test` +
Starts a session by displaying a flashcard (both question and hint) from the current folder.

**Hint toggle on / off feature** `Coming in v2.0`

When extra help is needed and familiarity with the content is not yet established hints can be toggled on during a test session when a ‘-hint’ is added on at the end of the test command. Hint will be displayed along with the question when the card is presented.

Format: `test [-hint]`

**Timer feature** `Coming in v2.0`

If you are preparing for an exam that will require you to recall information quickly within the limited time given.
This timer feature is just right for you! You will be given only 20 seconds to answer each question. If the 20 seconds is up before the question is answered, this attempt will be marked as wrong.

Format: `test [-timer]`

==== Keying in answer to a flashcard: `ans`

To reinforce learning and enable a more engaging experience with Know-It-All, one can input an answer for the
currently displayed flashcard question. Know-It-All compares the attempt with the correct answer in that card and
shows if it is correct or wrong.

====
* Answering a flashcard will increase the total number of attempts. If the answer is correct, the action will also increase the number of correct attempt.
* Answer matching is case insensitive.
====

If the answer has been submitted successfully and it is wrong, you will see the following page (see Figure 2).

.Wrong Answer page
image::WrongAnswerPage.png[width="790"]

If the answer has been submitted successfully and it is correct, you will see the following page (see Figure 3).

.Correct Answer page
image::CorrectAnswerPage.png[width="790"]

Format: `ans ANSWER`

Examples:

* `ans Mitochondrion` +
in response to the card question: What is the powerhouse of the cell?

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid if a card question is currently being
displayed in an active test session.


==== Reveal answer to a flashcard : `reveal` `Coming in v1.4`
Immediately reveals the correct answer. The user will not need attempt any answer before being presented the correct
answer.

Format: `reveal`

====
* This is equivalent to a wrong answer, so there is no addition to the correct attempts of this card.
====


[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid if a card question is currently being displayed in an active test session.

==== Go to next flashcard : `next`

Presents the next lowest score flashcard in this current test session. Upon a successful next command, you will see a
 similar page below (see Figure 4).

.Next card question displayed upon a successful next command
image::NextCommandPage.png[width="790"]

Format: `next`

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid if a card question and answer is currently being displayed  (has already done answering the question or revealed the answer) in an active test session. In other words, a flashcard cannot be skipped.

[NOTE]
There is no backtracking in the current session so there is no `prev` command.


==== End the current test or report session : `end`

Quits the current test or report session.

Format: `end`

=== Global Operations
The commands shown in this section are applicable regardless of whether the user is inside a folder or at the home directory.

==== Search by keywords : `search`

At the root directory, searches for folders using keywords in folder names. Within a folder, user can search for flashcards inside the current folder using keywords in flashcard questions.

Format: `search KEYWORDS [MORE_KEYWORDS]`


==== Import flashcards : `import`

Searches for a json file with the specified csvFile in the program directory and parses the file to generate a flashcard folder.

Format: `import FILENAME`

==== Export flashcards : `export`

Creates a json file containing the flashcards from the specified folder, which can later be imported.

Format: `export FOLDER_INDEX FILENAME`

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the application to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the card folder's content (`add`, `delete` and `edit`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

==== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.
