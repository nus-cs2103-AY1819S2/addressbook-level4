== Introduction

GradTrak is an application designed for students of National University of Singapore (NUS) to easily track their graduation progress.
The current version of the application offers graduation requirement tracking to some of the Computer Science majors (namely the Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering Focus Areas)
and stay tuned to this space as we will adding other courses in the near future!

Users can interact with the application by keying in inputs into the command box. Hence our first group of audience
is primarily the Computer Science majors as they can generally type more quickly than students
of other disciplines :D

== Installation Guide

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `GradTrak.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Module Plan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The Window for the application should appear in a few seconds.

== Quick Guide
.Parts of the user interface
[caption = "Fig. 1: " ]
image::annotated-ui.png[width="790"]

. Refer to `Fig 1` for parts of the interface. Here are the brief functionalities
of the user interface annotated above:

.. Task Bar: Users can use the task bar to exit the application or to access the help menu (this guide)

.. Command Box: Users can enter command to interact to access the features of the application here

.. Result Box: Users can know whether their command is successfully executed here or if their command
is not successfully executed, the application will tell them what are the appropriate inputs are.

.. Result Panel: Users can view the information associated with the command they have executed.

.. Modules Taken Panel: Users can view the details of the modules that they have taken
or are planning to take.

.  To access a feature of the application, type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. You might want to set your course of study first. Currently there are 3 courses
where the application can keep track of your graduation progress; namely Computer Science Algorithms,
Computer Science Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Software Engineering.
To set the course that you are currently studying in simply type the following:
`study Computer Science Algorithms` or  `study Computer Science Software Engineering`!
.  Some easy to follow commands you might want to try:
* **`add`**`c/cs1010 s/y1s1` : adds the module "CS1010", taken in Y1S1, into the module plan.
* **`delete`**`1` : deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.
* **`displayreq`**: displays information on your course requirement. Also displays the
the degree of completion of the requirement alongside suggestions for modules
that you can take to satisfy the course requirement
* *`exit`* : exits the app

Here we only introduced some of the more basic versions of functions and commands of GradTrak. The following section, <<Features>> ,
will give you a more detailed guide/walk through for each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user, e.g. in `add c/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/cs1010`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `c/MODULE_CODE [g/GRADE_OBTAINED]` can be used as `c/cs1010 g/A` or as `c/cs1010`.
====

=== Add module: `add`

Adds a module to the module plan based on the given module code, semester taken and expected / obtained grade. +
Format: `add c/MODULE_CODE s/SEMESTER [min/NEW_EXPECTED_MIN_GRADE] [max/NEW_EXPECTED_MAX_GRADE] [lec/NEW_LECTURE_HOURS] [tut/NEW_TUTORIAL_HOURS] [lab/NEW_LAB_HOURS] [proj/NEW_PROJ_HOURS] [prep/NEW_PREP_HOURS]` +

****
* Possible grade options are the standard letter grades (A_PLUS, A, A_MINUS, B_PLUS, B, B_MINUS etc.) and IC, EXE, CS, CU, W, S, U.
* You cannot add an existing module with the same semester.
* You can only add a module if you have previously added its prerequisites.
****

Examples:

* `add c/CS2103T s/Y2S2` +
Adds CS2103T, to be taken in Y2S2, to the module plan.

* `add c/CS2103T s/Y2S2 max/B_MINUS` +
Adds CS2103T, to be taken in Y2S2 with expected max grade B-, to the module plan.

Format: `cklimit`

=== Clear all data entered: `clear`

Deletes all the added modules. +
Format: `clear`

=== Sets the current semester: `cursem`

Indicates that the previous semesters must have a single finalized grade in the expected grade range. +

=== Display module information: `displaymod`

2 options to display module information, e.g. course description, prerequisites and courses succeeding the modules.
It is possible to search for multiple modules at the same time by typing the next module code preceded by a whitespace. +
Format: `displaymod [MODULE_CODE]++`

1 mode for o/OPTIONS include:

.  `o/info k/KEYWORDS n/[NUMBER]` *Coming in V1.3*
* Display top n (3 if last argument is left blank, capped at 10) information most related modules based on keywords inserted.

Examples:

* `displaymod CS2103T` +
Display all information with regards to Module: CS2103T i.e Module name, Module description etc. .

* `displaymod CS2103T CS2101 CS1010 ACC1002X` +

// tag::Displayreq[]
=== Display Course Requirements: `displayreq`
One of the core functions of GradTrak is to track whether the user has fulfilled his/her degree requirement.
As of `v1.3` of the application, GradTrak currently only has course information of 3 Computer Science major Focus Areas, namely:

* Algorithms
* Artificial Intelligence
* Software Engineering

You may refer to the guide on `study` command to understand how to set your current course of study.

Using the information of the modules the user has already taken or is planning to take in the future semesters,
this command informs the user whether they have completed a certain Graduation / Course Requirement. If a certain requirement is not completed, this command will also inform the user an approximate degree of completion of the requirement and also
at the same time, suggest some other modules offered by NUS which they can take to fulfill the requirement.

Format: `displayreq`

// end::Displayreq[]

=== Edit module: `edit`

Edits the semester or grade of a module in the module plan based on module code or index in the most recently displayed list. +
