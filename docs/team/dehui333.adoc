== About the Project
My team and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface addressbook for our
Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into a project management system for software engineering project managers.
This enhanced application allows managers to keep track of employees and projects under his/her management.
My role was to design and write the codes for the Statistics feature(with the `Stats` command). The following sections
illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the
user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following symbols used in this document:

== Summary Of Contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the
team project.

.. Enhancement added: I added the feature to be able to have an overview of all the ongoing projects and also the individual progress overview of individual projects.

• What it does: There are two ways to use it. When only the `stats` command is keyed in without arguments, an overview of all projects is given.
When the command is followed by a project name or an index (e.g. `stats 1`, `stats Project Apollo`), it returns an overview of the progress of the project.

• Justification: Our app is targeted at project managers managing many projects and it would be inconvenient for them to look
through the long lists of employees and projects to get the large picture of all the projects they are managing, that is why we have overview for
all projects. Individual project progress helps the manager to gauge the progress of individual projects so that they can adjust their plans accordingly.
• Highlights: This enhancement is very extensible and more useful statistics can be displayed if they are supported by the underlying data model.
• Credits:
* Teammates for fixing typos here and there in the documentations.
* There was originally a implementation section in the developer guide for the `stats` command by Daryl Tan, I have modified and extended
it to its present state.
* My teammate Jothi is the one who came up with the icons used in the documentations.

.. Other contributions:
* Coding
. Implementation of the part of the `removefrom` command which allows removal of employees or milestones from projects(Pull Request {empty}[https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-2/main/pull/79[#79]]).
. Implementation of the `delete` command which allows the deletion of projects from the app. Refactored the `delete` command of the original address book to one which deletes employees.
(Pull Request {empty}[https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-2/main/pull/39[#39]])
. Implementation of the `complete` command which allows indication of projects as completed.
