This application is a Java Desktop GUI application that is specifically designed for a recruiting agency for their processes about the candidates in their storage.

- **Some aspects about the application itself**:
* Although it is a GUI application, all the commands are taken through CLI (Command Line Interface). You can learn how to use it by reading User Guide Document linked below.
* This application requires Java 9 for a proper working experience.

- **A summary of what can be done through this application**:
* A new candidate can be added to the storage
* Candidates can be deleted
* Candidates can be edited according to their aspects
* Candidates can be filtered according to their every different aspect
* Candidates can be sorted according to their features
* Candidates can be listed and selected
* The processes made can be undone and redone
* A specific search according to the candidate name can be done
* All the candidate storage can be cleared.


- **In Version 2.0 (expected)**:
* CVs of the candidates can be shown in the right window block when they are clicked

- **In Version 1.4 (expected)**:
* Integration tests will be made for filtering, also some additions and improvements in unit tests will take place

- **In Version 1.3**:
** Unit tests for filtering processes are written.
