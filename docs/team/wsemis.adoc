== PROJECT: TeethHub

This portfolio summarizes my contribution to *Project: TeethHub*

== Overview

My teammates and I was morphed this program in a software engineering module. In a brownfield manner, we enhanced and expanded features in Addressbook Level 4.

The name of our program is TeethHub. It is a desktop application aimed for dentists who needs better data organization tools. Our program have functions in adding and editing patients, tasks and records, as well as other auxiliary functions. Our program interacts with the user in both command line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI).

Our program takes uses of libraries including TextFX, Jackson, Guava, JUnit5, Apache PDFBox and Apache Commons Logging. The GUI is written in JavaFX. In total, there are approximately 20k line of codes written in Java.

I have implemented several functions for the application including copy patients, copy tasks, sort tasks, list tasks and create medical certificate from a record. I also coded test cases for my implementations using JUnit. To facilitate the project, I have also made changes in GUI.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to copy patients and tasks*
** What it does: Allows user to make temporary copies of existing data entries for easy editing. The copy function does not violate the uniqueness of the data list as the copies are temporary. Exit with unedited copies will need user's confirmation.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because inputting data in the program is painful. In actual scenarios, entries sharing similar attributes are commonly seen. This function will improves the usability of our application in a large scale.
** Highlights: The implementation of the function needs coordination with logic, model and storage. It also needs to confront to the design rule of unique data list. A prompt is also added when user tries to exit without editing existing copies.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to generate an MC based on existing record*
** What it does: Allows user to generate MCs from our application directly without the need of inputting existing data again.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because generating MC is a common scenario. Since we have integrated this feature in our application, there is no need for the user to install another software and synchronize the data.
** Highlights: The implementation of the function takes use of PDF box library. It will extract information automatically from selected records and the corresponding patient. The design of the MC is neat and professional.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a sort command that allows the user to sort task list in time or priority order ascendingly or descendling.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Enhanced the result display to dispaly muilti-style text.
*** Mannually tested features teamate implemented. Found, reported several bugs and helped the debugging.

** Community:
*** Finded and reported bugs for projects in other groups (e.g. https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/pe-dry-run/issues/413[1], https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/pe-dry-run/issues/179[2])
