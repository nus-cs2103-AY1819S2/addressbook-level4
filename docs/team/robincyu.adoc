== Project Portfolio: Introduction

As an undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) taking the communication and software engineering modules CS2101 and CS2103T, I
worked on _Acquizition_, an application borne out of _AddressBook Level 4_, for the better half of a semester.

_Acquizition_ is a desktop flashcard application for language acquisition. It sports the following major features:

* A fully-fledged **quiz** functionality, equipped with a scientifically-grounded spaced repetition system (SRS) to maximize
retention rates.
* Comprehensive **statistics**, both by card individually and by tag in aggregate.
* Support for adding **images** onto flashcards in order to further strengthen connections between concepts in a way words
alone cannot do.
* Convenient **sharing** of flashcards amongst friends studying the same language.

These features were, of course, not all developed by me. You may be more interested in what I have
contributed as an individual.

In this case, I hope to use this project portfolio to make it clear to you exactly what my contributions to this project
were.

I hope to demonstrate to you my contributions to the following aspects of _Acquizition_:

1. Code Contributions
2. User Guide Contributions
3. Developer Guide Contributions

== Summary of contributions

=== Code Contributions

* *Major contribution*: I developed in its entirety the ability to insert images into flashcards.
** This feature improves the product quite significantly, as the ability to add images allows one
to more directly relate concepts to vocabularies.
** Implementing this feature required a focus on user-centric design, as I thought about how to
implement it such that it would be most intuitive to an end-user.
*** In the process, many alternatives were considered and scrapped. For example, adding images to
_Acquizition_ required importing the images first. This seemed more intuitive than making the flashcard
depend on files on the user's computer, and images suddenly not working when these image files were
moved.
** The implementation was also not straightforward; full image support required modifying both
the Graphical User Interface (GUI) aspect, to show the image, and the file storage aspect, to store
the images. These two tend to be particularly hard to work with, as they tend to have lots of dependencies
that need to be carefully considered. +

**Code:** https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-2/main/pull/92[[PR\] Image support fixes] +

* *Minor contribution*: I kick-started development by refactoring the majority of the code, removing a vast majority of the
references to AddressBook Level 4. +

**Code:** https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-2/main/pull/14[[PR\] Refactor AddressBook to CardCollection, Person to Flashcard]

=== User Guide Contributions

* **Major contribution**: I overhauled the User Guide in order to make it more user-friendly.
** I restructured the way in which commands were introduced (directly addressing end-user's issues rather than listing each command individually).
** I rewrote the "Introduction" and "Quick Start" sections to be more inviting, including illustrations and screenshots to further emphasize
user-friendliness.
** I used _tips_ and _notes_ to attract the reader's attention to important points.
** I added the user guide sections for issues related to image support.

=== Developer Guide Contributions

* *Major contribution*:
** I added the developer guide sections for developing code related to image support.
