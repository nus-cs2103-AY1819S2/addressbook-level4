* This is TeethHub. TeethHub is targeted towards Dentists who prefer to type.
* The primary function of TeethHub is to manage and store patient information and their records, and to display a representation of each patient's teeth.
* TeethHub can also export these information to PDF and display statistics generated from these information.
* TeethHub is a desktop application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command
Line Interface).
* TeethHub is developed *in an OOP fashion* in Java through the efforts of a five man team from NUS: https://cs2103-ay1819s2-w17-2.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[Jonathan Choo, Keith Sim, Kyler Wong, Lim Jia Hao and Wang Debang]
