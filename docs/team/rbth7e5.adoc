= Chen Caijie - Project Portfolio for The Food Diary
== Overview

This portfolio showcases my contributions to a software engineering team project for our software engineering module.
Our project, The Food Diary, is a food journal meant for tech-savvy food lovers looking to document
their food adventures. You can get personalised recommendations, document your food adventures as well as organise the
restaurants you have visited with categories so that you can easily filter them later.

My role was to implement the categorisation of restaurants as well as manage the git workflow of members.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements and the relevant sections I added to the User and Developer Guide.

Note the following use of symbols and formatting in order to understand their meanings:
