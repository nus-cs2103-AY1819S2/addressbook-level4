* This is a Hotel Management System. Hotels can use this system as a one stop application for all their management work.
* It has features to show customer details, and the respective customer's room reservations and service bookings along with it. We also generate the bill for the user.
* This application has been made keeping in mind that the user is more comfortable with typing commands and is a fast typer. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
