== Introduction

slaveFinder() is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, social Circle is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, social Circle can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
