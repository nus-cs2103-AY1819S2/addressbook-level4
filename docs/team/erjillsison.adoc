== Project Overview
The purpose of this document is to showcase the work that I have done for the project named "*Battleship*". The project was done as a requirement for the module *CS2103T Software Engineering* in *National University of Singapore*.

My team and I were presented with an existing code base for a command line interface (CLI) address book application. We were given about 8 weeks to either enhance or morph the address book application to a product of our own choice. We chose to morph it into *Battleship*.

*Battleship* is a desktop game application based on the classic guessing game, *Battleship*.
The user interacts with it using a command-line interface (CLI) and it has a graphical user interface(GUI) created using JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

My role was to design and write the code for the *map feature* of the game.
The following sections illustrate the feature in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to this feature.

== Summary of contributions
This section provides the summary of the contributions that I have made to the project.

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *map feature* of the game. This includes the internal data structure of the map, the cells that make up the map and how they are displayed in the UI.

** What it does: The player can initialise the maps to the size they specified using the command `init`. The players can place ships on their own map and shoot the opposing players map. The maps are displayed in the UI and each cell will change colour depending on its status. The `init` command can be used at any point in time during the game and will reset the board to a clean state.
** Highlights: The other features (e.g placing ships) rely heavily on the map. It requires careful planning on the design as the other features must be built on top of it and any changes made later on will affect the other features.
** Justification: The maps are crucial to the gameplay as it is the basis of all of the game interactions.
