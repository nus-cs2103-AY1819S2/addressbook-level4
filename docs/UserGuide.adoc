== Introduction

Welcome to TeethHub!
If you are a dental practitioner who prefers to use a Command Line Interface (CLI),
then TeethHub is an application for you!

TeethHub works primarily through a CLI while having elements of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For example, you can select and find patients and records by clicking on them, but you would need to type type the edit command to edit them.
TeethHub allows you to keep track of your patient's particulars along with their dental records.
An image of each patient's teeth will also be displayed according to what you input for each tooth's status(Absent, Problem, Healthy).
In addition to that, TeethHub also allows you to keep track of your upcoming tasks, just like a calendar.

Interested in trying TeethHub out? Check out <<prerequisites>> to see what programs you need in order for TeethHub to work properly.
If you’re confident in your computer set-up, jump to <<quick-start-guide>> to begin!

== Commands and Features

=== Help

Displays the help text for all available commands.

Format: `help`

=== File Management

TeethHub automatically saves all data in AddressBook.json when you close the program.
However, you can manage them manually with Open, Save, Import and Export. +
 +
You can use *open* to open another patient list that you may have transferred over from another computer. +
 +
You can use *save* to save your current patient list to another .json, so that you can transfer them to another computer. +
You can also use *save* to save your current patient list to a .pdf, which is nicer on the eyes.
 +
You can use *Import* to add select patients from another patient list to your current patient list. +
 +
You can use *Export* to save select patients to a .json or .pdf file.

==== Open
Opens the file in the specified file path and overwrites the current patients list.
** Note that 'open' always searches inside the data folder.
** You can only open .json files.

Format: `open FILE_PATH`

Examples:

* `open patients1.json` +
Replaces the current patients list with the patients list in "patients1.json".

* `open february\patients2.json` +
Replaces the current patients list with the patients list in "patients2.json" found in the "february" folder.


==== Save
Saves the current patients list to the specified filepath.
** Note that 'save' always saves inside the data folder. If no such filepath exists,
it will be created. Otherwise, it will overwrite the existing file.
** You can only save to .json and .pdf. +
.json files allow you to open or import them. +
.pdf files are easier for humans to read, but you cannot open or import them with TeethHub.

Format: `save FILE_PATH`

Examples:

* `save patients1.json` +
Saves the current patients list to "patients1.json".

* `save february\patients2.pdf` +
Saves the current patients list to "patients2.json" found in the "february" folder.


==== Import
Opens the file in the specified file path and adds the specified patients to the patients list.
** Note that 'import' always searches inside the data folder.
** You can only import .json files.

Format: `import FILE_PATH INDEX_RANGE`

Examples:

* `import patients1.json 1` +
Adds patient 1 from "patients1.json" to the current patients list.

* `import february\patients1.json 1` +
Adds patient 1 from "patients1.json" found in the "february" folder to the current patients list.

* `import patients1.json 1,4` +
Adds patient 1 and patient 4 from "patients1.json" to the current patients list.

* `import patients1.json 1-4` +
Adds patient 1 to patient 4 from "patients1.json" to the current patients list.

* `import patients1.json 1,3-5` +
Adds patient 1 and patient 3 to patient 5 from "patients1.json" to the current patients list.


==== Export
Saves the specified patients in the current patients list to the specified filepath.
** Note that 'export' always saves inside the data folder. If no such filepath exists,
it will be created. Otherwise, it will overwrite the existing file.
** You can only export to .json and .pdf. +
.json files allow you to open or import them. +
.pdf files are easier for humans to read, but you cannot open or import them with TeethHub.

Format: `export FILE_PATH INDEX_RANGE`

Examples:

* `export patients1.json 1` +
Saves patient 1 from the current patients list to "patients1.json".

* `export february\patients1.pdf 1` +
Saves patient 1 from the current patients list to "patients1.pdf" found in the "february" folder.

=== Teeth Management

==== Brief Description


TeethHub complies with the most popular standard of the
three the Dental Numbering Systems utilised in Dentistry - The
Universal Numbering System.


==== The Universal Numbering System

ifdef::env-github[]
image::BaseLayer.png[width="200"]
endif::[]

The upper-case letters A through T are used for primary teeth and the
numbers 1 - 32 are used for permanent teeth. The tooth designated "1" is
the maxillary right third molar ("wisdom tooth") and the count continues
along the upper teeth to the left side. Then the count begins at the
mandibular left third molar, designated number 17, and continues along
the bottom teeth to the right side. Each tooth has a unique number or
letter, allowing for easier use on keyboards.


==== Creating and Editing Teeth Layout
There are two templates provided by TeethHub: primary and
permanent.

All primary or permanent teeth in template will all be present and
healthy by default.


* To create a new teeth layout for patient:

** `teeth add n/NRIC <Template>`

** Note that if a teeth layout already exist, a warning will be thrown to
confirm your overwriting intention.

* To edit a new specific tooth:

** `teeth edit n/NRIC t/TEETH_LABEL s/STATUS -d/DESCRIPTION`

** Valid <Teeth Label> are letters A through T (case-insensitive, for
primary teeth), and numbers 1 - 32 (for permanent teeth).

** Note that if a teeth layout does not exist, a new layout will be created
based on the teeth label group used, before the edit is applied on the
newly created teeth layout.

** <Status> reflects overall health of the indicated tooth, and valid
<Status> are "healthy", "problem" and "absent".

** <Description> is an optional field that allows you to
write a note describing more detail on the patient’s teeth
health.

=== List
Shows a list of all patients or medical stored in TeethHub.

Format: `list [dental]`

Command shows patient details by default, add dental to see dental
records.

Example:

* `list` +
Shows details of all patients.


* `list dental` +
Shows details of patient's dental records.


=== Find
Shows patients whose data contains any of the given keywords according to a specified parameter.

Format: `find [dental] PREFIX/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* Add “dental” to search dental records instead.
* Search is case insensitive.
* Order of keywords does not matter.

Example:


* `find a/Yishun` +
Show all the people with an address containing the keyword Yishun.


* `find dental cleaning` +
Shows all the dental records with cleaning


=== Sort
Sorts the records by an input parameter in an input order.

Format: `sort PARAM ORDER`

Example:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|*ID* |*Name* |*Age* |*Last Modified*
|0 |Alice |19 |03/07/2003
|1 |Clara |12 |05/02/2021

== Cloud Functionality [Coming in v2.0]
To increase data redundancy and reduce the risk of data being lost,
you will be able to synchronise your data with a cloud account.


== Spell-Checker Functionality [Coming in v2.0]


Automatically correct an improperly typed command(e.g. sirt to sort).


== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

*A*: Install TeethHub in the other computer and overwrite the empty data
file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous
Address Book folder. Alternatively, upload your data to the cloud and
download it from there.
