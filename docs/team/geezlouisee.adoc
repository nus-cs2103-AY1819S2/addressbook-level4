== PROJECT: In-Credit-Ble

This is my project portfolio for _In-Credit-Ble_, a product that was developed as part of our Software Engineering module, CS2103T.

In this portfolio, I will be showcasing a brief overview of my total contributions to the team project, followed by excerpts of my contributions to _In-Credit-Ble_â€™s User Guide and Developer Guide respectively.

== Overview

_In-Credit-Ble_ is a finance tracker that is tailored to help users manage their personal finances in an easy and efficient manner. _In-Credit-Ble_ helps the user to achieve their financial objectives by helping them to keep track of their expenditure and be more aware of their spending habits. The application is designed for those who prefer to type over using their mouse, with the main mode of navigation in this application being a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Some of its key features include, but not limited to:

** An intuitive and easy to use user interface that allows you to add new records fast.
** Able to sort your list of recorded expenses by name, amount, date or category
** View a summary of your expenditures by their categories, illustrated as a pie chart

_In-Credit-Ble_ was developed by four friends and I, from the National University of Singapore. We had to adapt to an existing codebase that was written in Java and develop a functional product in a short span of 13 weeks.

== Summary of contributions
This section summarises my contributions towards the code, documentation, as well as other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement*: added *Summary* command to represent the overview of expenses in a graphical form
** What it does: Allows the user to view an overview of all their expenditures in a specified report period, represented as a single pie chart. Each sector represents a category, labelled with the name and amount spent in that particular category.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will be able to see a quick overview of their spending in a pictorial form. his allows users to easily identify which category they spend the most on and can afford to cut down on.
** Highlights: You can specify the report period of which expenditures should be represented in the pie chart. Else, the default report period that will be shown is the expenditures of the user in the last 7 days.
