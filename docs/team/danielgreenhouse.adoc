== PROJECT: Recruit Me

---

== Overview

Recruit Me is a desktop application designed for Recruitment Companies looking to store their client's data ergonomically.
It is an adaptation of AddressBook - Level 4 which is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to sort persons through various means*
** What it does: allows the user to sort the list of persons.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to sort through the client's data. It is pivotal in transforming the AddressBook to a Recruiting platform since it provides the user with multiple tools for visually seeing their clients in a logical manner.
** Highlights: This enhancement is fully compatible with the other commands and proves particularly useful to the user when used in conjunction with the `filter` command.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** changes to VersionedAddressBook and ModelManager to allow for deleting all persons at once and adding a person with the filter in place.
