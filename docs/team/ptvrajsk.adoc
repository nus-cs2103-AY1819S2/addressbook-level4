== Introduction

This document provides a detailed description of my contributions to
the several projects that I have been a part of over the years. +
My contributions will be substantiated with relevant technical application
and sources, if possible. +

== Project: PDF++

PDF++ is an application built on Java that acts as a document management system
that provides some advanced features that improve the quality of life of its
users. +
The application has a working Graphical User Interface (GUI), built upon the
JavaFX framework, that is supplemented with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
to accept more specific requests by the User. +
{nbsp} +
Although not built to its final form, it boasts a large feature set such as:

- Adding, Moving and Deleting Documents.
- Assigning Custom Tags to Documents.
- Filtering Documents by Custom Tags.
- Assigning Deadlines to Documents that provide a Visual Response to the User.
- Permanent Encryption and Decryption of Documents such that they require
set passwords to open even if accessed outside the application.
- Merging multiple documents into a single document.

=== Summary of Major Contributions

My Enhancements to the Project Consists of: +

* *User Interface (UI) Transformations*
** *What*: The UI is the main layer of PDF++ that interacts with the End-User
of our platform.
** *Justification*: The initial UI was insufficient in realising my vision
for our application. Hence through the use of the `FXML` Scripting Language and
`JavaFX` Library, I had reinvented the UI such that it would more accurately
support the application and all the additional features we had planned to add
to it.
** *Highlights*: The UI is fully compatible with the additional features of
PDF++ and would require minimal to no overhauls should any new aspects of the
application require upgrading.

* *Formulation and Introduction of Find Feature*
** *What*: The Enhanced Find feature is one of the core features that we had
planned to introduce in our application. It is a means for the target audience
to search for documents not just by their file name but also by the content
within them.
** *Justification*: Although the application was working well as a Document
Management System, analysis of the needs and wants of our target audience
was necessary. Following several informal discussions, a key feature that many
felt was lacking was the ability to easily find files that many, more powerful,
file managers were lacking.
** *Highlights* The find feature required drastic changes to the existing
`model` components as a menial version of it was already partially implemented.
As such there was key attention paid to the enhancement of the feature so as to
ensure that no other features would break because of it.

==== User Guide Contributions

===== User Interface

The UI had to include labels that displayed the Deadlines keyed in by the User
which had to reflect the duration to the due date by changing colours. The UI
also needed to have a default _Welcome Screen_ that served as a central
dashboard to the User. +
Furthermore, the dashboard had to be replaced with a details screen when the
User interacted with one of the Files in our application. +
These requirements meant that the UI had to heavily communicate with the
`logic` and `model` systems in the backend to produce the required behaviours. +
The relevant pull requests pertaining to this feature can be
referenced in the following _Github_ issue
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-4/main/issues/152[#152]. +
{nbsp} +
The scripted UI is attached below:

.User Interface

To illustrate to a new User, the UI also had to be broken down into digestible
chunks that could be easily comprehended by the user. As such the following
diagrams were also added to the Introductory paragraphs of the User Guide.

.User Interface Breakdown

.Individual File Breakdown

The information was further colour coded to ensure the simplicity of the
diagrammatical explanations.

===== Find Feature

As for the Find Feature, the main challenge was to simplify the actions carried
out internally by feature. As well as explaining the enhancements done to the
original find feature and what the current feature is capable of doing. +
The final input to the user-guide contains detailed images that allow the user
easily follow through the usage of the feature as well as understanding its capabilities.
Listed below is a summarised excerpt from the User Guide. +
The one of the relevant pull requests pertaining to this feature is
referenced in the following _Github_ issue
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-4/main/issues/161[#161]. +

'''

[#find-feature]
====== Excerpt from UserGuide: Finding Content: `find`

The find command allows you to `find` for files that contain a keyword or phrase
OR `find` files which contain the entered keyword or phrase inside it.

[#find-format]
[.big]#Format: `find KEYWORD`#

* `KEYWORD` refers to the word that you wish to search for within the files of the application.

Examples:

* `find Introduction` +
* `find Author: George RR Martin`

[#steps-find]
====== Step-By-Step Guide
If, for example, you wish to locate the files that contain the word `Introduction`
in its name or files that contain the word `Introduction` in its internal content.
You may carry out the following steps in-order to get your desired list of files. +

Step 1: Launch the application by double clicking the `pdfplusplus.jar`. To view the following screen.

[NOTE]
Files you observe may be different and depends on the actions you have previously carried out on our application

.Find Command Step 1 & Step 2

Step 2:

* As shown by the image, your application should contain an existing list of files.
* You are to key in the `find` command followed by the keyword as illustrated by the command
<<command-find, format>>.

Step 3:

* Finally, press `Enter` on the keyboard and give the application a short time to sieve through all the files
it manages and locate the relevant ones for you.
* Once the application is done with the task, the following screen should be visible to you.

.Find Command Step 3
image::UGFindFeatureImage2.png[width="500" align="center"]

As seen in the image, the files that are relevant to your search will be displayed on the top
left. These files are those that contain the keyword `Introduction` in its name, and files which
contain the keyword within its content. +

The application also shows you other useful information such as, the number of files that
match the criteria you entered into the application as shown in the image above. +

And with that, you have successfully utilized the `find` feature. +

[CAUTION]
When there are many files tracked by the application or if the files tracked by the application
contain many pages, the `find` command might take a little longer to operate. Hence if your
operating system warns you that the application is not responding, please give the application some time
to finish its operation.

[WARNING]
As part of a security measure, all files that are encrypted will not be subject to the `find` command.
This will prevent any information about your secure files from being leaked to malicious users.

==== Developer Guide Contributions

===== Find feature
In the developer guide, I had tried to make the explanations of the internal workings of the
feature as detailed as possible with references to the connections to the various components
of the application. These connections were illustrated, with attention to detail, through the
use of a sequence and activity diagram. +
Attached below is an excerpt containing the summarised entry of the find feature in the Developer
Guide. +

'''

====== Excerpt From Developer Guide: Find feature
====== Current Implementation
The `find` feature is facilitated by *FindCommand* and *FindCommandParser*.
This feature lists a subset of all the files in the application based on the keyword(s)
provided. Using the keyword(s), the application will check the names of all files, as
well as the content of the text within the files prior to revealing the results.

The `find` feature has the following syntax:

Format: [.big]#`find <KEYWORD> ...`#

* `<KEYWORD>` refers to the word that the application will use as a reference to find
files. There must be at least one provided.

Example:
* `find Resume`
* `find Introduction`

====== Feature Breakdown

The following image briefly summarises the interactions of the `find` command with
some of its immediate components.

.General Internal Illustration of Find Command.
image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="600" align="center"]

When the user enters the CLI Input for the find command, the command is first passed
from the `LogicManager` to the `PdfBookParser` will carry out the following steps.

1. The user inputs a request to `find` a keyword within the files of the application.
e.g. `find keyword`.
2. The `PdfBookParser` creates a new `FindCommandParser` upon recognising that the user
wishes to use the `find` feature.
3. Parse method within the `FindCommandParser` would create a `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` which will allow
  the `Model` to filter its list of files to show the user the requested files.
4. Finally, the `FindCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Upon receiving the `FindCommand` from the `PdfBookParser` the following steps are carried out.

1. The `execute` method is invoked from the `LogicManager` with the parameters of `model` and `history`.
2. The `model` then uses the `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` and runs the `test` method to check each file and
verify that it fulfils the predicate. This is so that the `model` can update itself to present the list of
files that the user wishes to view.
3. The `test` method invokes classes from the external link:https://pdfbox.apache.org/index.html[Apache PDFBox] library, namely `PDDocument` and
`PDFTextStripper` to extract the contents of the existing files.
4. The extracted content is then checked to verify if it contains the `keyword` input by the user.
5. Further checks are also done to confirm if each file's name contains the `keyword` as well.
6. The `model` then updates itself and stores the current action in the `history` object.
7. Finally, the `FindCommand` returns a `CommandResult` back to the `LogicManager` for follow up
action.

This is a brief explanation of the inner workings of the `FindCommmand` and its execution method.

====== Considerations
Our application also implements several security features such as the ability of users to `Encrypt` and
`Decrypt` their files. Hence, a major security concern was to prevent the `FindCommand` from searching
through the contents of files that are previously encrypted. This is crucial to prevent the leakage of data
as malicious users might simply utilize the `FindCommand` to extract information from the tracked files.

====== Future Implementation

. The main issue with the current implementation of the `FindCommand` is its slow speeds with respect to
large files or files that contain a large string of text files. Hence, a possible consideration you might
wish to improve upon is to "upgrade" this feature by improving its speed of this feature.

. Yet another enhancement to this feature you might wish to implement is the use of Optical Image Recognition,
otherwise known as OCR. This will allow the application to translate images within the file to words which would further
improve the ability of the application to look through content even if they are images.
