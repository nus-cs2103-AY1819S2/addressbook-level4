Are you a *Real Estate Agent* with a large number of different kinds of clients that you have to manage? Are you in need of a new desktop-based app with client management functions just to simplify your life a bit? Are you fairly comfortable with interacting with a CLI (Command Line Interface)?

If the answers are yes, yes and yes, then you've come to the right place!

*The Real App* is the desktop-based client management application meant just for you! It comes with a nice GUI (Graphical User Interface), but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI.
