== Introduction

The Food Diary (FD) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for storing their personal food reviews and obtain food recommendations*. More importantly, FD is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FD can get your foodie tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Some of the features that can look forward to:

* Keeping track of restaurants you've visited
* Getting an aggregate rating over all your visits
* Finding out about new restaurants near you for your next gastronomical adventure!
