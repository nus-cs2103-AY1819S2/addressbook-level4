Welcome to my Project Portfolio. Here you can find out more about my contributions in various projects to help you better evaluate my technical and communication skills.

== PROJECT: MediTabs
=== Introduction

MediTabs is a desktop application for managing medicine stock taking. It was created to provide pharmacist with a straightforward and efficient way to keep track of and maintain their medicine inventory.
MediTabs is a brownfield project that initially started as an address book application.
It was developed in a team of 4 as part of a software engineering module which spanned a total of about 13 weeks.

In this project, I was in charge of implementing the information panel feature.

=== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the information panel and the `sort` and `update` commands used to manipulate information on the panel.
** What it does: allows users to add, edit and remove information of different batches of medicine. This information is displayed in a table format for easy reference in the information panel. The panel also collates the information and provides a summary of important details such as total quantity and next expiry date. The table can also be sorted by batch number, quantity or expiry date.
** Justification: Organizing medicine by batch allows for quicker identification of problematic batches. With each medicine having multiple batches, a way to organize the information neatly to avoid confusion for the user is needed. The information panel provides a visual interface that is simple and well structured for users to refer to when updating their inventory.
** Highlights: A large amount of planning was done to decide what information would be useful to the user. Implementation was challenging as it not only involved changing existing commands (`add` and `edit`) but also adding functionality to every component of the architecture, namely Logic, Storage, Model and UI.

* *Minor enhancement*: Enhanced the existing `find` command to be able to search other fields. (Pull requests: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-3/main/pull/180[#180])
