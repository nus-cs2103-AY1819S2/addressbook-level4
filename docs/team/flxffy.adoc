== PROJECT: MediTabs

---

== Introduction

This project portfolio will give you an overview of the documentation, code and ideas I contributed to my team's project, MediTabs, as the team's front-end designer. This project was completed as part of an introductory software engineering module in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

== Project Overview

MediTabs is a desktop application built with the goal to streamline inventory management in a clinic for pharmacists. As part of the project's requirements, MediTabs targets users with a preference for command line interactions.

To achieve this goal, we implemented several key features: a warning panel to view urgent issues, an information panel to display medicine information, and data exportation for data analysis.

For this project, I was in-charge of implementing the warning panel and its related commands.

== Summary of contributions

This section highlights noteworthy contributions I made to the project's documentation and source code.

* *Major enhancement*: Added a warning panel and related `warning` commands

** What it does: The warning panel gives users an overview of what medicine batches are expiring/expired and what medicines are low in stock. Thresholds used to determine what is expiring and what is low in stock can be set by the user with simple commands.

** Justification: Simplifies the process of sieving through an inventory to find expiring/expired medicine batches that need to be disposed of, and medicines that require replenishing. User-defined thresholds add to the user experience.

** Highlights: This enhancement required an understanding of all major components to render and populate a column in the application's main interface with the correct lists of items, and to implement complementing commands to change its contents.

* *Minor enhancement*: Changed the implementation of the `Expiry` class. Previous implementation used a deprecated library (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Date.html[`java.util.Date`]) so it was changed to an updated one (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Date.html[`java.time.LocalDate`]).
