//tag:introduction[]
== Introduction
Welcome to the Developer Guide for *Equipment Manager*!

*Equipment Manager* is an application that allows engineers to keep track of the Preventive Maintenance schedule of all Resuscitation Devices in Singapore. It will help engineers plan the number of equipment to carry out preventive maintenance, and also keep track on each equipment details such as status and location. +

Objectives of the application include:

* Providing commands such as search and filter to search and filter equipment serial number, equipment status or work list respectively.

* Displaying location of equipment in Google Maps.

* Planning the most efficient route to take for visiting multiple locations.
//end:introduction[]

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/equipment/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.equipment.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
|The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below will give more details of each component; *UI*, *Logic*, *Model* and *Storage*.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component shows webpages e.g. `DisplayGmap.html` hosted somewhere on the Internet. To host a webpage yourself, you may put your webpage into `\docs\staticpages`. All pages in `\docs\staticpages` will be copied to `gh-pages` branch and hosted on `gh-pages`.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `EquipmentManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an equipment).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master//src/main/java/seedu/equipment/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the *Equipment Manager* data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Equipment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[TIP]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Equipment Manager`, which `Equipment` can reference. This would allow `Equipment Manager` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Equipment` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +

.Class diagram of Model Component
image::ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the *Equipment Manager* data in json format and read it back.
//end::design[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.equipment.commons` package.

[[Implementation-Commons]]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::equipment[]
=== Equipment feature
To provide users with the best understanding on the parameters of equipment in *Equipment Manager*,
this section will provide a brief overview on the equipment details as well as how the details of an equipment are
used for multiple features in the design of Equipment Manager. Not forgetting sharing some design considerations to make the best choice for *Equipment Manager*.

==== Overview on Equipment details

|===
| *Equipment Parameters* | *Description* | *Things to Note*
| NAME | The client's name who owns the equipment. | Name should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank.
| PHONE | The contact number of the client that owns the equipment. | Phone numbers should only contain numbers, and it should be at least 3 digits long
| DATE | The due date for which maintenance work on the equipment should be carried out by then. | Should only contain numbers and hyphens, no blanks allowed. The correct format is  dd-MM-yyyy. For example, 03-05-2019 which means 3 May 2019.
| ADDRESS | The address of the client that owns the equipment. |
| SERIAL_NUMBER | The serial number of an equipment | All equipment have unique serial number and there should not be duplicated serial number.
| TAG | Tag provides user with desired labels without any restriction on labelling format in *Equipment Manager*. An equipment can any number of tags (including 0).
|===


==== Current Usage of Equipment Details
In order to allow users to keep track of the Preventive Maintenance schedule and carry out features provided by Equipment Manager, we have implemented the following commands with the usage of the equipment parameters as mentioned in the previous section.

*An example of how the parameters of equipment are used:*

* When user execute the `AddCommand` or `EditCommand`, there are equipment details stored in *Equipment Manager*.
* When user uses command like `DisplayCommand`, *Equipment Manager* will need to use the address details to provide visual representation of the location of client that owns the equipment.
* When user uses command like `SelectCommand`, *Equipment Manager* will need to use all the equipment details in order to reflect more detailed information on equipment in the *Equipment Details Page*.

==== Current Implementation
Using `AddCommand` mentioned in previous section as an example,
the *add equipment* mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedEquipmentManager` which extends the `Equipment Manager`.
The results of this command will be displayed under *Equipment Details* panel.

The following sequence diagram shows how the *add equipment* operation works:

.Sequence diagram for `AddCommand`
image::AddCommandSD.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the adding of equipment details mechanism behaves at each step after carrying out `add-e`.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `add-e n/Pending CC pm/01-05-2019 p/99887766 a/8 Pending Rd, Singapore 678295 s/XDH1429387 t/north-west` command.

Step 3. After `EquipmentManagerParser` detects `add-e` as the command word, a `AddCommandParser#parse()` is called.

Step 4. `AddCommand#execute()` is then called.

Step 5. The parser will parse all the attributes and add into equipment and client models respectively.

Step 7. The model now contains details of equipment and client, and returns to GUI for display on *Equipment details* and *Client details* panels respectively.

With that, you may refer to <<Display feature>> to see how *Equipment Manager* will then use the address details to provide visual representation of the location of client that owns the equipment.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects: What attributes are important for equipment details to serve the purpose of *Equipment Manager*.

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Equipment details contain client details whom own the equipment and equipment unique serial number.
** Pros: This allows users to know that each equipment has unique serial number and each client can own multiple equipment. Do not have to make major enhancement, save time on backend work.
** Cons: Might be confusing to user if user is not clear how Equipment Manager works as it may seem like there is duplicated equipment.

* *Alternative 2*: Equipment details only has serial number and create a seperate class to store store name, phone, address, as client details.
** Pros: By reading the structure, it is clearer to user that the attributes describe equipment or client.
** Cons: More backend work needs to be change, takes up a lot of time.

//end::equipment[]

//tag::worklist[]
=== WorkList feature
To help users understand how this feature, *WorkList*, works in *Equipment Manager*,
this section will give an overview on the WorkList details and how users can interact with WorkList based on the commands implemented
in the design of Equipment Manager. It also provides some design considerations to give users an insight of how the current solutions are worked out.

==== Overview on WorkList details

|===
| *Attributes* | *Description* | *Things to Note*
| Date | The tentative maintenance date on the equipments in the WorkList. |
| Assignee | The name of the person who is assigned to conduct the maintenance work. |
| WorkListId | The id of a WorkList | All WorkLists should have unique id and there should not be duplicated id.
|===

==== Current Usage of WorkList Details

In order to allow users to user WorkList to help them organize their equipments and assign their work, we have implemented several
commands as follows with the usage of WorkList details and also some Equipment details.

*An example of how the attributes of WorkList are used:*

* When user execute the `AddWorkListCommand` or `DeleteWorkListCommand`, the added WorkList details stored in *Equipment Manager*,
and the deleted WorkList details will be deleted from *Equipment Manager*.
* When user uses command like `PutCommand`, *Equipment Manager* will help users to put the selected Equipment into the specified
WorkList, such that they will know those equipment are in the WorkList with one specified assignee and date.
* When user uses command like `RemoveWorkListCommand`, *Equipment Manager* will remove the selected Equipment from a
specified WorkList, it could be the case that users put the equipment into a wrong WorkList, they want to put the equipment
into a different WorkList or they just finished maintaining that equipment so they want to remove it from the WorkList.

==== Current Implementation
Using `AddWorkListCommand` mentioned in previous section as an example,
the *add WorkList* mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedEquipmentManager` which extends the `Equipment Manager`.
The results of this command will be displayed under *WorkList Details* panel.

The following sequence diagram shows how the *add WorkList* operation works:

.Sequence diagram for `AddWorkListCommand`
image::AddWorkListCommandSD.png[width="800"]

Below is an example of the step-by-step mechanism of `add-w` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `add-w d/09-05-2019 a/Mary i/13` command.

Step 3. After `EquipmentManagerParser` detects `add-w` as the command word, a `AddWorkListCommandParser#parse()` is called.

Step 4. `AddWorkListCommand#execute()` is then called.

Step 5. The parser will parse all the attributes and add into WorkList models.

Step 7. The model now contains details of WorkList, and returns to GUI for display on *WorkList details* panels.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects: What should be the relationship between the WorkList and Equipments.

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: The WorkList is a independent class and can contains a list of Equipment objects.
** Pros: This is more organized and it is clear that WorkList contains some Equipments.
** Cons: Might be confusing the users that why there are so many relationships and these classes are interacting with each other.

* *Alternative 2*: Equipment is our major work and WorkList is just contains some Serial Numbers just for displaying purposes.
** Pros: Easy to implement and users are able to know which part they should focusing on more, which is Equipment in this case.
** Cons: It is hard to do more. If in the future, we intend to do some features like display the equipments in some certain WorkList,
then it will be quite hard to implement such a feature.

//end::worklist[]

//tag::client[]
=== Client feature
This section describes features specific to client, how having client details contribute to the features in *Equipment Manager* as well as our design considerations.
There may contain some repeated explanation when describing this sections
because attributes of client and equipment are being shared in order to for features to be carried out in *Equipment Manager*.

==== Overview on Client details
In Equipment Manager, there are `Name`, `Phone`, `Address` attributes stored under *Equipment details* that identify client details.

* A client can have 0 to numerous equipment which are identified by unique serial number but an equipment cannot be shared by multiple clients.
** By using `select-c` to select the desired client name in *Client details* pabel, we can view a list of equipments that are owned by the client.
* Each address tells user where 0 to numerous equipment, which each client owns, are located at.

==== Current Usage of Client details
As mentioned in <<Current Usage of Equipment Details>>, the `Address` which belong to the client address, are used in features like `DisplayCommand` and `SelectCommand`.

==== Current implementation
There is `SelectClientCommand` that is supported by  `SelectClientCommandParser`.
This selection of client details mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedEquipmentManager` which extends the  `Equipment Manager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the selection of client details mechanism behaves at each step after carrying out `select-c`.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `select-c 1` command.

Step 3. After `EquipmentManagerParser` detects `select-c` as the command word, a `SelectClientCommandParser#parse()` is called.

Step 4. `SelectClientCommand#execute()` is then called and set the selected client in the model with the filtered client list.

Step 5. Using the `filter` feature, the model will use the `Name` attributes, filter the equipment list accordingly and displays the client's equipment in the *Equipment details* panel.

Step 7. The model now contains additional client name and returns to GUI for display on *Client details* panel respectively. The model also contains filtered client's equipment and returns the GUI for display on *Equipment details* panel.

[NOTE]
The figure in Current Implementation of <<Equipment feature>> also explains how `AddCommand` contributes to the results shown in *Client Details* panel.

==== Design Considerations
Refer to the *Design Considerations* in <<Equipment feature>> as we went through the same design considerations to come out with equipment and client details separation.

===== Aspects: With a list of client displayed in *Client details* panel, how should the client's equipment details be displayed?

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Making use of the `filter` command to show client's equipment
** Pros: Making use of existing *Equipment details* panel. Easier to implement with lesser changes to the storage, logic, model and ui components within the time constraint.
** Cons: select followed by a filter command is stored in the history even though user did not use filter command. This is the trade off.

* *Alternative 2*: Add a new equipment panel and card for displaying client's equipment when selecting the client
** Pros: Do not have the issue of filter command being tracked in history even though user did not use the filter command.
** Cons: Too many different panels in one main window display may cause confusion and lower user's experience.
//end::client[]

//tag::filter[]
=== Filter feature

==== Introduction
We have implemented a `FilterCommand` that allow users to filter the equipment list with the specified fields.

The filter feature allow users to filter the equipment list with any specified fields, and also can filter by multiple fields.

The `FilterCommand` is able to filter the equipment list according to the user's preference at a time.

==== Current Implementation

The *filter* mechanism is supported by `FilterCommandParser`. It implements `Parser` that implements the following operation:

- `FilterCommandParser#parse()`  -  Checks the arguments for empty strings and throws a ParseException if empty string is found.
It then splits the arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` and returns an ArgumentMultimap. Keywords of the same prefix are then grouped using `ArgumentMultimap#getAllValues()`.

The *filter* mechanism is also facilitated by `FilterCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the following operation:

`FilterCommand#execute()`  —  Executes the command by updating the current `FilteredPersonList` with the `EquipmentContainsKeywordPredicate`.

`EquipmentContainsKeywordsPredicate` takes in the lists of keywords for the following:

- Name
- Address
- Date
- Phone
- Tags
- Serial Number

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

image::FilterCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Example*

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the filter mechanism behaves at each step when filtering.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `filter n/jurong a/west t/urgent` command to get all fields whose equipment contains the keywords

Step 3. After `EquipmentManagerParser` detects *filter* as the command word, a `FilterCommandParser#parse()` is called and
the EquipmentContainsKeywordsPredicate is constructed with the arguments of the filter command.

Step 4. `FilterCommand#execute()` is then called.

Step 5. The entire equipment list is filtered by the predicate `EquipmentContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

Step 6. Then, `EquipmentContainsKeywordsPredicate` checks that the *Equipment Manager* has either the respective
attributes - serial number, tags, address, name, preventive maintenance date, phone.

Step 7. The argument is filtered against the predicate and returned to the GUI.

[TIP]
`FilterCommand` only filters the equipment list.

==== Design Considerations
*Implementation of `FilterCommand`*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Require user to prepend every keyword argument with the appropriate attribute prefix.
Supports multiple fields in the same command.
** Pros: It is easy to implement and easy to match keyword against an equipment if the matching attribute is known.
** Pros: User has more control over the results returned.
** Pros: User can also filter by multiple fields.
e.g: `filter n/jurong t/west`
** Cons: User is required to type slightly more.
** Cons: It only filters the equipment list.

* **Alternative 2:** filter by specific fields

** Pros: It is easy to implement and it is also consistent with how `FilterCommand` works.
** Cons: User has less control over the results returned.
** Cons: User can input anything and the results returned is not specific by type.

* **Alternative 3:** filter by tags
** Pros: It is more specific and more restricted.
** Cons: More difficult to implement
** Cons: Too restricted as it is only filtered by tags.
// end::filter[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort feature

==== Introduction
We have implemented a `SortCommand` that allow users to sort the equipment list with specific field.

The entries in the equipment list is ordered to the time when the entry is entered into the application by default such that the entry entered first is at the top of the equipment list and the latest entry entered is at the bottom of the equipment list.
The `sort` mechanism allows user to view the equipment list according to their preferences.

The `SortCommand` is able to sort the equipment list according to the user's preferences at a time.

==== Current Implementation

The `sort` command sorts the list by specified field in lexicographical order.

Comparators that implement `java.util.Comparator` interface are used in the *sort* mechanism to perform the comparsion.

The *sort* mechanism is supported by `SortCommandParser`. It implements `Parser` that implements the following operation:

- `SortCommandParser#parse()` -  Checks the arguments for empty strings and throws a ParseException if empty string is found.
It then splits the arguments and checks if the next string is a valid field, else, it will throw a ParseException.

Valid fields:

- name
- date
- phone
- serial

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Example

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the sort mechanism behaves at each step when sorting.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `sort name` command to sort the equipment list by name.

Step 3. `SortCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `NameComparator()` object and passes it into `SortCommand`.

Step 4. `EquipmentManager#sortEquipmentList(comparator)` calls `UniqueEquipmentList#sortEquipmentList(comparator)`, which then
uses FXCollection’s static method `sort()` to sort the equipment list by name.

Step 5. The list is sorted by specified field (name) and returned to the GUI.

Test cases:

- Input: `sort`

Output: An error message will be displayed to show what are the fields available.

- Input: `sort name`

Output: The list is sorted by the name in alphabetical order.

- Input: `sort date`

Output: The list is sorted in ascending order by the the preventative maintenance date of the equipment.

- Input: `sort phone`

Output: The list is sorted in ascending order by the phone number of the client.

- Input: `sort serial`

Output: The list is sorted in ascending order by the serial number of the equipment.

[TIP]
`SortCommand` only sorts the equipment list.


==== Design Considerations
*Implementation of `SortCommand`*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): **Sorts by specific field by using the Comparator interface.
** Pros: Sorting can be done based on different fields (name, date, phone number and serial number)
** Cons: A new class that implements the interface Comparator needs to be created for the fields.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort by client name
** Pros: Overall list is sorted fully by client name
** Cons: Unable to sort other specific fields such as serial number of the equipment.
// end::sort[]

// tag::display[]
=== Display feature
The display feature allow users to view the location of all equipment in the current shown list on map.

==== Current Implementation

The following activity diagram shows each action is done by which component.

image::DisplayActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the display operation works:

image::DisplaySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 1. The user launches the application, the list of equipment will show in `UI` and stored in the `Model`.

Step 2. The user executes `display` command to show all the equipment on the map. The execution of `display` command will return a `CommandResult` indicating `display` which can be checked by `CommandResult#isDisplayMap()`. The `MainWindow` will check if the `CommandResult` is a display map command. Then `MainWindow#handleDisplayMap` will be called. `MainWindow#handleDisplayMap` will call `Logic#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the equipment list, and then call `Equipment#getCoordiantes()` on each equipment to get its coordinates.

Step 3. The `Equipment#getCoordiantes()` calls to `Google Map Geocoding API` with the address returned by `Equipment#getAddress()`. The API will return the coordinates of the address. This will be returned as the coordinates of the equipment. The coordinates will be stored for future use.

[NOTE]
`Google Map Geocoding API` is not free to use. You need to have your own API key to use the API. You may check link:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding[`Google Map Platform - Geocoding Service`]

Step 4. The coordinates are constructed to form a URL and call a web page in `BrowserPanel` to display the map. Currently the map is stored as `/docs/staticpages/DisplayGmap.html` which will be copied and published by Travis CI robot to `github pages`. You may either use your own `github pages` URL by changing `BrowserPanel#MAP_MULTIPLE_POINT_BASE_URL` to your own `github pages` URL, or use the current URL published by `CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3` team.

Step 5. The webpage receive the coordinates in parameter form. It will first parse the parameters. The standard form of parameters is `?coordinates=[[1.3012,103.1233], [1.4323, 103.2012]]&otherfields=["abc", "def"]`. The number of elements in other parameters must match the number of elements in the `coordinates` parameter. The map may be extended to handle more functions, however the current parameter parser can only handle parameters in this standard format. For now, only coordinates are used, other parameters will be ignored.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to display the base map
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate web page, pass the coordinates as parameters.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Flexible to add more functions. Many JavaScript libraries can be used.
** Cons: Unexpected behaviors would happen if the WebEngine cannot display the web page properly.
* **Alternative 2:** Use third party JavaFX map libraries.
** Pros: No unexpected behaviors, and more consistent running on different platforms.
** Cons: Harder to implement, less flexibility, and limit to extensions.

===== Aspect: Which JavaScript Map library to use
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Google Map JavaScript API
** Pros: Easy to embed other Google Map APIs, and work better with JavaFX built in browser.
** Cons: Harder to customize the style of map, marker and etc. (Compared to `Alternative 2`)
* **Alternative 2:** Use MapBox GL JS.
** Pros: Easy to have customized view, better looking themes.
** Cons: Works bad in JavaFX default built in browser, and harder to cooperate with Google API.

===== Aspect: Call `Geocoding API` to get coordinates in main application or built in browser
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** In main application
** Pros: Addresses are reusable, i.e. only need to call `Geocoding API` once for each equipment.
** Cons: Harder to make the function call, and increase the hang up time when many equipments do not have coordinates retrieved.
* **Alternative 2:** In built in browser with JavaScript
** Pros: User will get instant response and see the base map after entering the command, although the actual display will come later.
** Cons: Addresses will not be reusable, each time user enter `display` would call `Geocoding API` for each equipment and incur high API costs.
// end::display[]

// tag::route[]
=== Route feature
The route feature allow users to know the best order to traverse through all equipments listed in the equipment panel. The order will be shown on the map.

The following sequence diagram shows how the display operation works:

image::RouteSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Current Implementation

Step 1. The user launches the application, the list of equipments will show in `UI` and stored in the `Model`.

Step 2. The user executes `route` command together with the origin address to display the route starting from the origin address, travel through all equipments, and go back to the origin address. The execution of `route` command will return a `CommandResult` indicating this is an `route` command which can be checked by `CommandResult#isRoute()`. The `CommandResult` also contains start address parameter called `routeAddress` of `Address` type. The `MainWindow` will check if the `CommandResult` is a route command. Then `MainWindow#handleRoute` will be called.

Step 3. `MainWindow#handleRoute` will call `Logic#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the equipments list, and then call `Equipment#getAddress()` on each equipments to get its address.

Step 4. The addresses are constructed to form a URL and call a web page in `BrowserPanel` to display the map. Currently the map is stored as `/docs/staticpages/DisplayRoutes.html` which will be copied and published by Travis CI robot to `github pages`. You may either use your own `github pages` URL by changing `BrowserPanel#MAP_ROUTE_BASE_URL` to your own `github pages` URL, or use the current URL published by `CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3` team.

Step 5. The web page receive the addresses in parameter form. It will first parse the parameters. The standard form of parameters is `?address=["Address 1", "Address 2"]&start="Origin address"&end="Destination address"`. The order of parameters does not matter.

Step 6. The JavaScript code in the web page will call `Google Map JavaScript API` to calculate the best route to each addresses, and display the route on the map.

[NOTE]
`Google Map JavaScript API` is not free to use. You need to have your own API key to use the API. You may check link:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial[`Google Map Platform - Maps JavaScript API`]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Passing addresses or coordinates to web page
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Passing addresses to web page
** Pros: Better accuracy, as addresses would interpreted more accurately than coordinates when involving routing.
** Cons: Worse data reusability, waste API calls, because the data retrieved from the `Google Map JavaScript API` cannot be send back to the main application and stored.
* **Alternative 2:** Passing coordinates to the web page
** Pros: Save some API calls.
** Cons: Worse accuracy.

[NOTE]
Calling `Google Map JavaScript API` to retrieve the route is much more expensive than calling `Geocoding API` to retrieve the coordinates. Thus, it is fair to prioritize to utilize function of `Google Map JavaScript API` to retrieve the route.

===== Aspect: How to pass the origin address to UI
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Passing as a parameter in `CommandResult`
** Pros: Minimal code changes.
** Cons: Need to create more constructor of `CommandResult`, and it may get harder to understand the usage of these constructors.
* **Alternative 2:** Storing as a field in `Model`
** Pros: Easier to understand and use.
** Cons: Require more code changes because changing `Model` interface will break many classes and tests.

===== Aspect: How to pass extra parameters to `CommandResult`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use overloading of the constructor
** Pros: No need to change the caller code of the constructor, decrease the possibility of code conflicts when merging with teammates' code.
** Cons: As more fields are added to `CommandResult`, more constructors will be added. As a result, it may confuse future developers.
* **Alternative 2:** Directly modify the `CommandResult` class and its constructor signature
** Pros: More straightaway and easier to understand.
** Cons: Changing the constructor signature also need to change all the caller functions. So it requires changes of many classes which may bring code conflicts.

=== User Interface (UI)
The UI of *Equipment Manager* is a combination of JavaFX, HTML and CSS.
This section describes our overall current implementation for UI as well as
showing our thinking process for the UI in designs considerations section.

==== Current implementation
===== Launch the Application

.On start of the Equipment Manager application, UI with labels
image::ui_labelled.png[width="790"]

The figure above depicts the interface the user see when the user launches the application.
The user should be greeted by 9 different regions:

|===
| Regions of Application | Purpose
| [1] *Menu Bar* | Allow users to click `File` > `Exit` to exit the application and click `Help` to navigate to our User Guide page.
| [2] *Command Box* | User enters the command in the command box. Refer to *User Guide* to learn all the available commands.
| [3] *Message box* | The message box that shows the result after a command has been executed.
| [4] *Status Bar* | Show the total number of equipment in the *Equipment Manager*.
| [5] *Google Map*  | Google map serves as a visual representation for where equipment are at as well as showing user the possible routes to take.
| [6] *Equipment details* panel | This panel shows summarized details on equipment
| [7] *Equipment Details Page* | This is a HTML page where it shows more detailed information on an equipment.
| [8] *Client Details* panel | This panel shows specifically information related to client such as the name and how many equipment the client owns.
| [9] *My Work List* panel | This panels shows the work schedule of a person when the user assigns equipment whom the user want to carry out preventive maintenance work.
|===

===== Showcasing Client details
To avoid cluttering to many information in *Equipment details* panel,
we decided to categorise information related to clients into *Client details* panel
such as showing all the unique client names in Equipment Manager as seen in the figure below.

.Client name listed under Client details panel
image::AddClientDetailsUI.png[%autowidth]

===== Showcasing Equipment details and locations
Similarly, there are many information to be shown in *Equipment details* panel.
Hence, as seen in the figure below, we created a HTML page to show more information
on equipment. This means that there are some information not shown in *Equipment details* panel but will instead be shown in *Equipment Details Page*.

.Incorporating HTML in panel to show more equipment details
image::equipmentdetailsUI.png[%autowidth]

One of our main feature of *Equipment Manager* is the ability to have a visual representation on 1 or more equipment in a *Google Map*.

.Outcome of `display` feature on UI
image::clientlocationsUI.png[%autowidth]

As seen in the above figure, entering `display` command will allow a visual representation of all equipment locations in the *Equipment Manager* data storage onto *Google Map*.
This is one of our main feature of *Equipment Manager* where we provide users to view either 1 equipment location at a time by entering `select` INDEX or simply by clicking onto the an equipment in *Equipment details* panel.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects: Information to be displayed on respective panels

* Alternative 1: Showing all client, worklist, equipment resulting commands in one panel.
|===
| Pros | Lesser panels will have lesser clutter to user experience. UX experience will be better.
| Cons | Harder to implement. Require to work with label that is able to change when panel has changed to serve other purposes such as from displaying equipment details to worklist details in the same panel.
|===

* Alternative 2 (Current Choice): Show client, worklist, equipment resulting commands in 3 respective panels.
|===
| Pros | Easier to implement. To avoid confusion on which panel is being updated, we added a header label above each panel.
| Cons | Application looks more cluttered with more dividers for different panels.
|===
// end:: uiug[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedEquipmentManager`.
It extends `EquipmentManager` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `EquipmentManagerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedEquipmentManager#commit()` -- Saves the current *Equipment Manager* state in its history.
* `VersionedEquipmentManager#undo()` -- Restores the previous *Equipment Manager* state from its history.
* `VersionedEquipmentManager#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone *Equipment Manager*  state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, `Model#undoEquipmentManager()` and `Model#redoEquipmentManager()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedEquipmentManager` will be initialized with the initial *Equipment Manager* state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single *equipment manager* state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete-e 5` command to delete the 5th equipment in the *Equipment Manager*. The `delete-e` command calls `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, causing the modified state of the *Equipment Manager* after the `delete-e 5` command executes to be saved in the `equipmentManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted *Equipment Manager*r state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add-e n/Clementi CC ...` to add a new equipment. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, causing another modified *Equipment Manager* state to be saved into the `equipmentManagerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, so the *Equipment Manager* state will not be saved into the `equipmentManagerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the equipment was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoEquipmentManager()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous *Equipment Manager* state, and restores the *Equipment Manager* to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial *Equipment Manager* state, then there are no previous *Equipment Manager* states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoEquipmentManager()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoEquipmentManager()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the *Equipment Manager* to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `equipmentManagerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest *Equipment Manager* state, then there are no undone *Equipment Manager* states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoEquipmentManager()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the *Equipment Manager*, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, `Model#undoEquipmentManager()` or `Model#redoEquipmentManager()`. Thus, the `equipmentManagerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `equipmentManagerStateList`, all *Equipment Manager* states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/Clementi CC ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire *Equipment Manager*.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-e`, just save the equipment being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of *Equipment Manager* states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedEquipmentManager`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

All files under `\docs\staticpages\` will be copied to final output documentation folders as well. You may put any static pages you want to public to `\docs\staticpages`.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.equipment.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.equipment.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.equipment.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.equipment.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
