== Introduction

Welcome to the _MediTabs User Guide_. You can find step by step instructions on how to set up MediTabs and take advantage of the features provided by MediTabs to optimise your clinic's medicine stock taking workflow. Interested? You can jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== What is MediTabs?

MediTabs is a desktop application for managing medicine stock taking. You can use MediTabs in your clinics to easily track of your medicine inventory and take note of important information such as which medicines are low in stock and which medicines are expiring soon.

MediTabs supports Windows, Linux and MacOS operating systems.

=== Who is it for?

If you are looking for a medicine stock taking application for clinics, MediTabs is the product you are looking for. Whether you are an owner of a clinic or a pharmacist in charge of your clinic's medicine inventory, you can use MediTabs to help improve your workflow. It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MediTabs can get your medicine stock taking done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest version of `meditabs.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the `meditabs.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your MediTabs application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all medicines in the inventory

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `e.g n/NAME [t/TAG] can be used as n/Paracetamol t/Popular` or as `n/Paracetamol`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), t/Ordered, t/PhasingOut t/SlowMoving etc..

=== Exporting as CSV file format : `export`

You can export the current Medicine Inventory data shown in the GUI as Comma-separated values (CSV) file format which is supported by many commonly used spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel (Windows), LibreOffice (Linux) or Numbers (MacOS).

This feature is especially useful if you want to save the current Medicine Inventory data in a file so that it can be printed later or if you want to organise the Medicine Inventory data using a spreadsheet application for you, your superior or your supplier's reference.

In addition, you can even use the spreadsheet application to convert the CSV file to Microsoft Excel format and use all the functionalities provided by Microsoft Excel such as drawing graphs or chart to display the overview of your clinic's medicine inventory. +
Format: `export [FILE_NAME]`

****
* The `FILE_NAME` field is optional. You can refer to <<Appendix A: File Naming Convention>> for supported file name format if you want to specify a file name for the exported CSV file.
* If no file name is specified, the export command uses the default file name format according to the date and time of export.
* The specific data and time format used if no file name is specified is `dd_MMM_yyyy_HH_mm_ss` e.g. `18_Mar_2019_10_28_00`
* The file extension for a CSV file is `.csv`
* The exported file can be found in the default `exported` folder which can be found in the home folder used for your MediTabs application.
* If the default `exported` folder is not found in the home folder, MediTabs will automatically create the folder when the export command is executed.
****

Examples:

* `export` +
Exports the current Medicine Inventory data shown in the GUI to a CSV file which has a default file name format `{Date of export}_{Time of export}`. e.g. `18_Mar_2019_10_28_00`
* `export example` +
Exports the current list shown in the GUI to a CSV file which has the filename `example`.

[WARNING]
If a file with the specified file name already exists in the default `exported` folder, the file would not be exported and an error message `"Could not export data to csv file: {Specified File Name} already exists in "exported" directory"`

A sample image of how the Medicine Inventory data in the exported CSV file is organised:

image::SampleCSVFileImage.png[width="790"]

[NOTE]
From the image above, you can observe that different batches of the same medicine have their own row in the CSV file. This provides more detailed information on the quantity and expiry date for each batch of the same medicine as different batches of the same medicine can have different expiry dates and quantity.

=== Printing labels : `label`

You can label any specific medicine information in the inventory using the Portable Document Format (PDF). +
Open the PDF file under the PDF folder to view and print your selected medicine +
Label will include name of medicine and standard label template. +
This includes the company that manufactured it, expiry date and the tags that was set with it. +
Format: `label INDEX [f/FILE_NAME]`

****
* Outputs the label for the medicine at the specified INDEX.
* If no file name is specified, the default file name is `to_print`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed medicine list.
* The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …
* All files output can be found under the PDF folder.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`label 2` +
Outputs label PDF file for 2nd medicine in the list with default file name `to_print`.
+
image::label2_example.png[width="790"]
+
* `find Simvastatin` +
`label 1 f/Simvastatin` +
Outputs label PDF file for 1st medicine in the results of the `find` command with file name `Simvastatin`.
+
image::label1_example.png[width="790"]
+
[WARNING]
The `label` command will overwrite the `to_print` file every time it is used. Hence, do print the required file first before using the `label` command again. This extends to all other existing file names.

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

== Appendix A: File Naming Convention

MediTabs uses the following File Naming Convention when File Name field is used e.g. The `export` command's optional `[FILE_NAME]` field. The File Naming Convention is to ensure consistency and to avoid potential bugs involving file names with different operating systems such as Windows, Linux and MacOS +
Format: `Start with an alphabet or number followed by alphabets, numbers, underscore or hyphen`

[IMPORTANT]
You must follow the File Naming Convention format when specifying the File Name field for any commands that support File Name as a field.

[CAUTION]
The characters of the File Name cannot contain any spacing or symbols, including but not limited to, `\/:*?"<>|.+[]{};!@#$%^&~``
