== PROJECT: The Infinity Machine

---

== Overview

Our project, the Infinity Machine, is an application useful for efficient management of textual information
of any kind, say research material. It allows users to store information by the their *title*, *type*, *details* and multiple *tags* and allows
for easy search, retrieval, edit and delete functions. Intended to be used through the Command Line Interface, and targeted at
tech-savvy, university students looking for an efficient, simple yet powerful way of maintaining their resources.

== Summary of contributions

== *Major enhancement*: +

==== 1. Modified *the ability to search* through sources:

===== *Modification*:

Format: `search [n/TITLE] [y/TYPE] [d/DETAILS] [t/TAG] [t/TAG]...`

The work I have done on AB4's search feature can be divided into 3 major modifications as follows:

1. *Multiple prefix tags of different (and same) kinds*: The search function now has an added functionality of being able to take in multiple
arguments of the *same* and *different* type of source fields [except author], and search for sources based on its conjunction.

2. *Substring matching with incomplete words*: It is enabled with substring matching as against exact field matching.
Each argument is checked for its presence inside the source
fields and a source is found only if all the user entered arguments are present inside the source's respective field values.

3. *Auto-correction feature for typing mistakes*: It is also able to find string matches with minor typing errors in the spelling,
implemented using Levenshtein distance or the edit distance. The implementation current accounts for less than 5 character swaps needed to transform between the strings
entered by the user and the entire field value of sources.

===== *What it does*:
It allows the user to search through all the entries in the database through various fields at a time, same and different, and display
source entries that satisfy all of the entered tags in conjunction, with substring matching and typo accommodation.
It allows compound searches to be made, allowing user to narrow down their search, hence helping in efficient retrieval
of the sources, and making working on the database more efficient. It also reduces the onus on the user to remember and recall
the source entries maintained by allowing them to enter as many consecutive characters for a field value they can enumerate.

===== *Justification*:
This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now search an entry with a particular title AND a particular type and so on.
Furthermore, it removes the reliance on the user to memorize exact field values, by enabling substring matching and multiple tags
entered so the user can enter as much as he remembers and see the results.

It helps user greatly narrow down their search should they be looking for a specific source entry with particular values,
instead of cluttering the screen with all those sources with share the same title as the one the user searches using the command.
It also allows user to search sources based on other fields and not just title, such as type, tags and details, and even their
logical combination, along with allowing the user to not memorize his source fields.

===== *Highlights*:

- This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future. +
- However, it changed the format of the original `search` command, which now not only takes parameters of different types, but also needs them to be prefixed by their
CLI delimiters.
- If any seemingly unwanted results are displayed after a search command is executed, it should not be seen as a bug as this is
the intended behaviour because of the two features that render the search result space more broadened than before [substring matching and typo accommodation].
- Rest assured, the intended results will never be missed out.

===== *Credits*:
Most of the feature was developed independently, with some design and implementation considerations discussed with fellow team members.

=== *Minor enhancement*:

==== 1. Modified *the ability to list* sources:

===== *Modification*:
Format: `list [N] [M]` +
Inside [] means optional.

The new modification to the command changes its format optionally, allowing user to be able to pass either one, two or no parameters
and list only those many sources from the entire source list.

The various formats now accepted are:

1. *`list` with no arguments*: Works as the original `list` command and shows all the sources and their details, unfiltered.
2. *`list N` with one positive argument*: Shows the top N sources with all their details only.
3. *`list -N` with one negative arguments*: Shows the last N sources or the Top N sources from the bottom with their details.
4. *`list N M` with two positive arguments*: With M>=N, shows sources between the indices N and M (included) with all their details only.

All these resulting sources are appropriately numbered as 1, 2 .. and so on regardless of their index in the original source list.

===== *What it does*:
It allows the user to now pass optional arguments to `list` command and then displays only those indexed source entries in the original source database as per the cases above.
The original working of the `list` command showing all entries is still maintained, with now 3 added functionalities.

===== *Justification*:
This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now list only as many item he wants and need not clutter the screen by displaying all.
It helps him to narrow down his search by being able to specify what indices of the original sources (say by time of addition) what he like to view. This ensures more effective retrieval and
operations on the sources, such as following it by index dependent operations such as `edit` and `delete` for instance.

===== *Highlights*:
- This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future.

===== *Credits*:
Most of the feature was developed independently, with some design and implementation considerations discussed with fellow team members.

=== *Other contributions*:

==== Project management:
*** Helped in maintaining issue tracker and milestone progress, along with managing project releases and reviewing and merging
pull requests.
*** Helped in refactoring Storage AP in migrating the codebase from AB4 to The Infinity Machine for our team, helped in refactoring the entire Storage package
to be compatible with the functionalities required by our application, mostly changing identifier names and method signatures to model

some problematic edge cases.
***  Enhanced javadocs for implemented methods to make their functionality and logic more
relevant to our application's scope, changing parameter and return type along with modifying format and functionality explanation.
