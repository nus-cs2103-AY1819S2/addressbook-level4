---

== Overview

Fashion Match is a desktop apparels matching application that recommends user the appropriate combination of apparels based on their the apparels they owned. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the Apparel Management feature which comprises of sort and list. Sort feature allows user to sort by name, colour or clothing type. As for list, it is an improved version of the previous list feature. The new list allows user to supply options in order to list the apparels according to the parameter supplied by the user.
** What it does: allows the user sort the apparels in any valid way. To find out about the valid way of sorting, user can simply type `sort options` which output all the valid sorting options.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might want to arrange the apparels in a certain order for easy viewing.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation taps on existing command. Truly adopt the spirit of "Don't reinvent the wheel".
** Credits: None.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a <name of command> command that allows the user to <Do what>.
