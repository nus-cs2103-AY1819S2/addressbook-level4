== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`*
* The Java Development Kit, or JDK for short, provides the necessary existing
 libraries and implementations that we have used in our implementation of
 HealthHub. The current version of HealthHub needs at least JDK version 9 to
 support the full functionality it has to offer.
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
* IntelliJ is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) that provides the
necessary tools and available plugins needed to compile, build and run the
project.
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

[NOTE]
====
Don't have Intellij or JDK installed? Click on the following links to
download them below:

* IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

* Java Development Kit: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
====

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources`. For Mac/Linux environments, run the command `./gradlew processResources` instead. It should finish with the [green]`BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Getting started

When you have set up your environment successfully for building and running
HealthHub, you are ready to get started on coding to contribute to the
project. But before that, you may consider familiarising yourself with
HealthHub through the following:

* Familiarising yourself with the model, logic and storage design of
HealthHub under the section <<Design>>.

* Get a good feel of how existing features are implemented under the
<<Implementation>> section.

* Follow the way that the testing suite for features are built in
<<Testing>>

* Painlessly automate build integration by following the steps under <<Dev Ops>>

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.


[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete request 1` command
image::logicseqdiagram.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::ui-header[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui[UI Package]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RequestListPanel`, `InfoPanel`, `HealthWorkerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc.

All of these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the `UiPart` class, which is an abstract class containing methods for handling the loading of `FXML` files.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to the `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data dynamically.
// end::ui-header[]

// tag::logic-header[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::logicclassdiag.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `HealthHubParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a request) or sometimes only affecting the display (eg. listing all requests).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as printing out the result message in the command line.

// end::logic-header[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::modelUmlDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores the `Request` Book data.
* stores the `HealthWorker` Book data.
* Both `HealthWorkerBook` and `RequestBook` stores multiple previous states
in the form of `ReadOnlyHealthWorkerBook` and `ReadOnlyRequestBook`.
* A `UserPrefs` object denoting the user settings for the application.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we store a list of `Request` objects in `Request Book`, which stores the details of every request, including the patient's details, request date and status.
In addition, each `Request` also stores a `Set` of `Conditions` of the patient. +
Similarly for `HealthWorker`, the list of `HealthWorker` is stored in a
`HealthWorkerBook`, and each `Specialisation` that the `HealthWorker` has is
stored in a `Set` that is contained in the `Skills` class.

// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Request, HealthWorker Book data in json format and read it back.

[NOTE]
The storage class converts the object data of `Request` and `HealthWorker` by converting the objects
into a json object of strings which will be stored in the `.json` file. When reading the file, the json library passes the respective strings into
their java object constructors to recreate the objects.
// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

The `add`, `edit` and `delete` command have been tweaked to include addition of and `Request` and `HealthWorker`.

`CommandMode` Enum class was introduced in v1.1 to allow for `add`, `edit`
and `delete` different types of objects respective to the different
`CommandMode` Enums. The various `CommandMode` enums are:
** `CommandMode.HEALTHWORKER`
** `CommandMode.REQUEST`
** `CommandMode.OTHERS`
** `CommandMode.INVALID`

Each `CommandMode` enum is matched by it's own corresponding set of keywords,
 which are string equivalents of the enum counterparts that the user can
 input to specify the type of object he/she wishes to add. For example:

* The command string `add healthworker n/Dog Terr` that is entered by the
user contains the keyword `healthworker` after the `add` command word, which
is mapped to it's `CommandMode` equivalent in `AddCommandParser`.

The `CommandMode` enum also has a `Set<HealthWorker` field which contains
mappings from a set of keywords to it's respective `CommandMode` values for
translation of user input into it's corresponding `CommandMode` equivalents.

Then implementation for `CommandMode` is as follows:

```
public enum CommandMode {

    HEALTH_WORKER,
    REQUEST,
    OTHERS,
    INVALID;

    public static final String MODE_HEALTHWORKER = "1";
    public static final String MODE_REQUEST = "2";
    public static final String MODE_OTHERS = "4";
    public static final String MODE_INVALID = "5";

    private static final Set<String> healthWorkerModes = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("healthworker", "h", "1"));
    private static final Set<String> requestModes = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("request", "r", "2"));

    /**
     * Method that checks for the corresponding CommandMode given a string input.
     * Returns INVALID if input string does not match any of the given modes.
     */
    public static CommandMode checkMode(String input) {
        if (healthWorkerModes.contains(input)) {
            return CommandMode.HEALTH_WORKER;
        } else if (requestModes.contains(input)) {
            return CommandMode.REQUEST;
        }

        return CommandMode.INVALID;
    }
}
```

These `CommandModes` provide flexbility and functionality to switch between
 parsing of different `HealthWorker` and `Request` objects.

* Each of the `add`, `edit` and `delete` command is eventually parsed through
 the `AddCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser`
 classes respectively, which returns an `AddCommand`, `EditCommand` and
 `DeleteCommand` object respectively.

=== Add feature

The `add` command allows for users to register new `HealthWorker` and
`Request` objects into HealthHub.

The format for the `add` command is as follows:

`add <keyword> <parameters>...` +

When the user inputs an `add` command, the `add` command is eventually passed
 into an `AddCommandParser` object that handles the argument fields after the
  `add` keyword in the command.

The `AddCommandParser` first checks the first keyword in the string for a valid
`CommandMode` string equivalent. if the keyword does not contains a valid
string representation of any `CommandMode` enum, then a `ParseException` is
thrown by the `AddCommandParser`. This initial sequence of steps is also
repeated in the following `EditCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser` objects.

After checking for valid keyword, the `AddCommandParser` object checks for
the following compulsory information, along with regular expressions checking
 for validity of each field:

==== Adding a `HealthWorker`

Format: `add healthworker/h/1 <parameters>...` +

* `name` field prepended by the `n/` prefix. Valid inputs of `name` field
will be represented and stored as a `Name` class object.
** `name` field can only contain alphanumeric characters, and cannot be an
empty string.
* `phone` field prepended by the `p/` prefix. Valid inputs of `phone` field
will be represented and stored as a `phone` class object.
** `phone` contains only 8 numeric digits, of which the first must start with
 a 6,8 or 9.
* `nric` field prepended by the `i/` prefix. Valid inputs of `nric` field will
be represented and stored as a `Nric` class object.
** `nric` field must contains a 9 character string, starting with either a S
or T, followed by 7 numeric digits and a alphabet letter. All letters used
must be capitalized
* `organization` field prepended by the `o/` prefix. Valid inputs of
`organization` field will be represented and stored as a `Organization` class
object.
** The `organization` field must contain only alpha numeric characters, and
contain at least 2 characters.
* `specialisation` field prepended by the `s/` prefix. All valid
`specialisation` fields will be parsed into it's respective `Specialisation`
enum equivalent, collected and stored as a `Set<Specialisation>` in the
`Skills` class object.
** The values in  the `specialisation` field will be only be accepted if
they correspond to specific mappings to an existing `Specialisation` enum that
are registered in HealthHub. For information on the valid Specialisation
mappings, visit <appendix for Specialisation num>

`AddCommandParser` first checks for the presence of the prefixes for each of
the compulsory fields mentioned above. If any of them are missing, or if any
invalid fields as per the conditions mentioned above, then the
command is invalid and a `ParseException` is thrown.

If the keyword denoted maps to `CommandMode.HEALTHWORKER`, then
`AddCommandParser` constructs a `HealthWorker` object representing the health worker that is
just added with the respective `Name`, `Phone`, `Nric`, `Organization` and
`Skills` objects parsed from the user input, and returns an `AddCommand`
contain the constructed person to be added.

[NOTE]
====
If multiple fields of the same prefix are added, the last value of the last
field will be the one accepted for all fields except the `specialisation` field.
====

Upon a successful `add` command, the new `HealthWorker` or `Request`
constructed from the user entered fields will be added to the end of the `UniqueHealthWorkerList`.

===== Valid Specialisations

The `Specialisation` field is an `Enum` type in Java, and supports only the
enum fields that are specified in the `Specialisation` class itself.

The various available specialisation enum values of the `Specialisation`
class is as follows in the implementation of `Specialisation`:

```
public enum Specialisation {

    GENERAL_PRACTICE,
    CARDIOLOGY,
    ENDOCRINOLOGY,
    NEUROLOGY,
    ORTHOPAEDIC,
    PAEDIATRIC,
    GYNAECOLOGY,
    UROLOGY,
    PATHOLOGY,
    HAEMATOLOGY,
    PHYSIOTHERAPY,
    OCCUPATIONAL_THERAPY,
    ANAESTHESIOLOGY;

    ...
}

```

=== Add Request feature

==== Current Implementation
The `add request` command allows the `LogicManager` to create a new request and add it to the list of requests. Adding a new request requires the
patient's name, patient's phone number, patient's address, patient's NRIC number and the patient's conditions. The format of the add request command is
add request n/NAME p/PHONE i/NRIC a/ADDRESS dt/DATETIME c/CONDITION.

The following sequence shows the sequence when the add command is execute by the LogicManager:

image::addrequest.png[width=800]
Figure 3.2.1.1 Sequence Diagram for `add request` command

From the diagram above:

.  `LogicManager`'s execute is called when the administrator keys in `add request` and it calls upon `parseCommand` of `HealthHubParser` to parse the command
.  `HealthHubParser` will initialize `AddCommandParser` and invoke the method `parse` to further parse `request` command
.  `parse` will be invoked and passed the parameters of the add command.
.  If all the arguments of the `add` commands are valid, `AddRequestCommand` will be returned to the `LogicManager`
.  `LogicManger` will then calls the method `execute` method of `AddRequestCommand`
.  `AddRequestCommand` will call `addRequest` passing `Request` as an argument to `Model` and after calls `commitRequestBook` method from `Model`
.  A `CommandResult` will be returned at the end.

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Data Structure for the list of Requests
* **Alternative 1 (Current Approach):** Using a `UniqueRequestList`
** Pros: The comparison is not as rigid. You can create requests with similar names/phones as long as it passes a less stringent criteria.
** Cons: You need additional overhead. You need to create an extra class and function to check.

* **Alternative 2:** Using a `Set`
** Pros: Do not need an extra function. You can use use `equals` for comparison
** Cons: It is a strict check and as a result you will not be allowed to create requests with same phone/same name etc.

===== Aspect: Data Structure of `Request`
* **Alternative 1 (Current Approach):** All parameters in `Request` are abstracted out to have a class of its own (with the exception of the HealthWorker).
** Pros: It adheres to the Single Responsibility Principles (SRP) and the Separation of Concerns (SoC) as each parameter checks whether it is valid
** Cons: Many different classes are created which increases the complexity of the code

* **Alternative 2:** Store all parameters of `Request` as `String`
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Violates SRP as one single class will need to check if the arguments are valid.

[NOTE]
The `RequestStatus` class within the `Request` object utilises the Java `Enum` to ensure type safety in user inputs.

The implementation of the `RequestStatus` class is as follows:

```
    private enum Status {
        PENDING,
        ONGOING,
        COMPLETED
    }

     public RequestStatus(String status) {
         this.requestState = Status.valueOf(status);
     }

     public RequestStatus() {
         this(Status.PENDING.name());
     }
```

Through this, any user String that is passed in as an argument for the `RequestStatus` field is automatically type checked,
ensuring that there are no invalid request statuses entered.


=== Edit feature

The `edit` command allows users to modify details of existing `HealthWorker`
or `Request` objects should the information need to be updated.

The format for the `edit` command is as follows:

`edit <keyword> <index> <parameter> [<parameter>]...` +

Similar to the `add` command, the `edit` command arguments are first checked
passed into the `EditCommandParser` class instance, where it evaluates for a
valid first keyword and argument prefixes and values. Additionally, the
`<index>` field is also checked against the existing list of `HealthWorker`
or `Request` to ensure that the provided `<index>` is a valid `<index>` in
the list.

The argument field after the first keyword denoting the specified
`CommandMode` must not be empty, and must contain at least one valid prefix
and a valid value for the respective field to be edited. The prefixes and
validity follows the same conditions as stated in the `add` command.

[NOTE]
=====
Similar to the `add` command, only the last value will be accepted for fields
 with the same prefixes.

If any `specialisation` fields are entered, the current `Skills` object of
the `HealthWorker` object being edited will be entirely replaced by a new
`Set` of `Specialisation` that corresponds to valid `specialisation` fields
enteed by the user.
=====

==== Editing `HealthWorker`

Upon parsing the argument string into `EditCommandParser`, it first checks
that the `<index>` field provided is non-negative, and not greater than the
size of the `UniqueHealthWorkerList`.

After checking for a valid `CommandMode.HEALTHWORKER` keyword after the
`edit` command word, `EditCommandParser` then tokenizes the argument string
after the keyword into a `ArgumentMultiMap` object that stores the prefix to
values mapping for each field specified. If no prefixes, or invalid prefixes
are specified, or if invalid values for any prefix is input, then
`EditCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`, and displays an error message
to the terminal.

If all values specified are valid and at least one field to specify is
provided, the `EditCommandParser` parses the `ArgumentMultiMap` containing
the values to be updated and it's respective prefixes into an
`EditHealthWorkerDescriptor` object. `EditCommandParser` then passes the
`EditHealthWorkerDescriptor` and the `HealthWorker` object fetched from the
`HealthWorkerBook` using the specified valid `<index>` into a
`EditHealthWorkerCommand` object and returned.

In the `EditHealthWorkerCommand`, each `HealthWorker` related field prefix is
checked for it's value in `EditHealthWorkerDescriptor`, and if a value
exists, it replaces the current value of the corresponding field in the
`HealthWorker` object. Else, the field in `HealthWorker` is unchanged.

Upon a successful `edit` command, the `HealthWorker` or `Request` object that
 has had it's fields edited will immediately reflect the changes in details on
  the GUI.

=== Delete feature

Using the `delete` command, the user can remove `HealthWorker` and `Request`
objects from the system.

The format for the `delete` command is as follows:

`delete <keyword> <index>` +

The `delete` command takes in only two arguments after the `delete` command
word: the `<keyword>` corresponding to the respective `CommandMode` enum, as
well as the `<index>` of the `HealthWorker` or `Request` object to be
deleted, as indicated in the `UniqueHealthWorkerList` or `UniqueRequestList`
displayed in the GUI.

The `<index>` entered by the user is one-based, while it is converted to it's
 zero-based format in HealthHub during the deletion process. This ensures
 that non-technical people who use HealthHub do not need to adjust to
 zero-based indexing, and can continue using one-based indexing which they
 are more familiar with.

If the user enters an invalid `<index>` field, such as a negative index or an
 index that is greater than the size of the `UniqueHealthWorkerList` or
 `UniqueRequestList`, then a `ParseException` will be thrown, and an error
 message will be displayed to the user.

Upon successful `delete` of a valid `HealthWorker` or `Request`, the removed
entity will be immediately reflected on the GUI, and be removed from view.


// tag::assignrequest[]
=== Assign Request feature

The assign request feature allows an administrator to assign a request to a particular healthworker.

==== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence flow from the `LogicManager` to the `ModelManager` when a user enters a `assign request` command:

image::assignreq.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.1 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` component interactions for `assign request` command.

image::assignReqToHw.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.2 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` and `Model` component interactions for [blue]`AssignRequestCommand`.

image::addHwRequestDates.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.3 Sequence diagram illustrates addition of the relevant `Date` objects into the `TreeSet<Date>` of the `healthWorker`.

image::checkConflictingRequests.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.4 Sequence diagram illustrates interaction between `AssignRequestCommand` and `healthWorkerAppointments`

1. When `LogicManager` receives the `execute` command, it calls the `parseCommand` method in `RequestBookParser`.
2. `RequestBookParser` will receive `assign` as the command and instantiate `AssignRequestCommandParser` to further parse the command.
3. If the arguments specified in the `assign` command are invalid, a `AssignCommand` will be created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.
4. `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute` command of `AssignCommand`
5. `AssignRequestCommand` will proceed to call the `getFilteredRequestList` method of `Model`.
6. Iterate through the `requestIds`, if valid, add the `request` corresponding to that `index` to the set of `Request`.
7. Iterates through all the requests already assigned to that `healthWorker`. If there is a conflict of schedule (i.e Requests assigned
to that healthWorker are less than 2 hours apart), a `CommandException` is thrown.
8. Writes the updated request to the `RequestBook` in `ModelManager`, if all the request timings are valid.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Algorithm in ensuring no clashing requests assigned to healthworkers - Data Structure and implementation
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Using a Balanced Binary Search Tree (java `TreeSet`) to keep track of the [blue]`RequestDate` of each request attended to by a particular `healthWorker`.
** Reasoning: Since the allowed time interval between 2 consecutive requests should be at least 2 hours, we can take advantage
of of this by only keeping track of the start time of requests. Hence we can utilise the `ceiling()`, `contains()` and `floor()` methods of the `TreeSet`, which runs effeciently in O(log N) time (where N is the number of requests). Here is the code snippet that implements this:
```
    // Note: healthWorkerAppointments is the TreeSet that stores the appointment dates
    Date date = request.getRequestDate().getDate();
    calendar.setTime(date);
    calendar.add(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, -MIN_REQUEST_DURATION); // MIN_REQUEST_DURATION = 2 hours
    Date lowerLimit = calendar.getTime();
    calendar.add(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 2 * MIN_REQUEST_DURATION);
    Date upperLimit = calendar.getTime();

    if (healthWorkerAppointments.contains(date) || (healthWorkerAppointments.lower(date) != null
          && healthWorkerAppointments.lower(date).after(lowerLimit))
          || (healthWorkerAppointments.higher(date) != null
          && healthWorkerAppointments.ceiling(date).before(upperLimit))) {
              throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_HEALTHWORKER_OCCUPIED_CANNOT_ASSIGN);
    }

    healthWorkerAppointments.add(date);
```

image::assignRegionCheck.png[]
Figure 3.3.1.5 Shows visualisation of time ranges that are valid.

The above mentioned code snippet checks that there are not clashing requests that fall within the red region, as depicted in Figure 3.3.1.5.

* Alternative 2: For each request to be assigned, manually iterate through the Request list to ensure that there are not clashing dates.
Pros: Easy to implement
Cons: Slow - in the worst case, if all the requests get assigned at once, this operation will run in O(n^2) time.

===== Aspect: Relationship between [blue]`Request` and [blue]`Healthworker`
* Alternative 1 (current choice): The [blue]`Request` holds a unique identifier of the [blue]`HealthWorker` (i.e the `NRIC`) assigned to it.
** Pros: Simplification of implementation.
** Pros: Cleaner implementation, low level of dependencies on other modules. This also makes it easier to test, and easier to maintain.
** Cons: Makes it difficult to obtain all details of the `healthWorker` assigned from a [blue]`Request` object. The healthworker with the unique NRIC will have the be queried from the `healthWorkerList`

* Alternative 2: The `Request` holds a `HealthWorker` object and the `HealthWorker` keeps track of a list of `Request`s.
** Pros: Can quickly access details of a `HealthWorker` from a `Request`, and can quickly access the `Requests` assigned to a `HealthWorker` from the `Request`.
** Cons: Increases complexity of code base, adding additional dependencies to the code. This makes the code base more verbose and more difficult to maintain.

// end::assignrequest[]
=== List Feature
The `list` command allows the user to be able to display all `HealthWorker`
or `Request` objects stored in the current application.

==== Listing `HealthWorker` objects
* Format: `list healthworker/h/1`
* Displays all `HealthWorker` objects already stored in the current
application, and the following details:
** `name` - Name of the `HealthWorker`
** `nric` - NRIC of the `HealthWorker`
** `organization` - Organization of the `HealthWorker`
** `skills` - Skills and Specialisations that the `HealthWorker` object
possesses

==== Listing `Request` objects
* Format: `list request/r/2`
* Displays all `Request` objects already stored in the current
application, and the following details:
** `name` - Name of the patient that made the request in `Request` object.
** `address` - Address of the patient
** `condition` - Condition of the patient that made the request.

=== Filter Feature

With the filter command, users can provide specific parameters that act as
conditions for HealthHub to filter the `UniqueHealthWorkerList` and
`UniqueRequestList` by. Using these parameters, HealthHub displays only the
`HealthWorker` or `Request` whose fields contains the specified parameters.

Command Format: `filter <keyword> <prefix>/<parameter> [<prefix>/<parameter>]
...`

[NOTE]
====
The `<prefix>` and `<parameters>` specified in the command descriptions
below follow the same valid prefix and parameter formats as the `add`, `edit`
 and `delete` commands
====

==== Filtering `HealthWorker`

The command format for filtering `HealthWorker` is:

`filter healthworker/h/1 <prefix>/<parameter> [<prefix>/<parameter>]...`

The fields in `HealthWorker` that the user can filter by are:

* `name` prepended by `n/` prefix
* `organisation` prepended by the `o/` prefix
* `specialisation` prepend by the `s/` prefix

[NOTE]
====
If multiple `specialisation` fields are provided, HealthHub will filter the
`UniqueHealthWorkerList` by displaying `HealthWorker` that contains both
specified `specialisations
====

HealthHub filters the respective list of `HealthWorker` and `Request` by
checking if the corresponding field contains the specified parameter as a
substring. +
For example entering the command `filter h n/John` displays a list of
`HealthWorker` whose name equals to John, or contains John as a substring(E.g
 Johnny, Johnson).

// tag::filterHealthWorker[]
==== Filtering `HealthWorker`

The `filter` command allows users to display only `HealthWorker` or `Request`
 whose fields matches the `<parameter>` specified in the filter command.

Format: `filter healthworker/h/1 <prefix>/<parameter> [<prefix/<parameter>]
...`

* The `filter` command checks for `HealthWorker` whose field specific to the
`<specific>` contains or matches the `<parameter>` provided.
* Example: `filter h n/John` changes the UI to display only `HealthWorker`
whose name is John, or contains John (Johnny, Johnson, ...)

Upon entering the `filter` command, the `filter` command word is stripped from the
 input and the argument fields are passed into the `FilterCommandParser` class.
The regular expressions for checking the fields for `name`, `organisation`
and `skills` follows the same format as mentioned in `add` command. If
invalid parameters are specified by the user, or if an invalid `keyword` was
specified that does not correspond to any `CommandMode` enum, then
`FilterCommandParser` throws a `ParseException` and displays an error message
 to the user.

If valid inputs are provided, `FilterCommandParser` tokenizes the argument
string without the `keyword` using `ArgumentTokenizer` object, mapping each
parameter to it's respective prefix in an `ArgumentMultiMap` object.
`FilterCommandParser` then creates a `Predicate` object using the parameter
values in `ArgumentMultiMap` for each filter condition, and composes them
into a single `Predicate` using the `and` function in `Predicate` in
conjuction with `stream` and `reduce` methods from Java's `Function` library.
 The `Predicate` object composed is then passed into
 `FilterHealthWorkerCommand`, which sets the predicate for the `HealthWorker`
  list in the GUI to display only `HealthWorker` whose fields matches the
  `Predicate` set.

===== Design Considerations

During the implementation of the `filter` command, we decide between two
alternative implementations of managing the `Predicates` created from
multiple criteria input by the user.

The following table states the considerations for performance as well as
future implementations and enhancements to HealthHub that were taken into
account:

// tag::filterHealthWorkerTable[]
[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Design
| Using a `List` of `Predicate`
| Composed `Predicate` using `and` method

| How it works
| Each user input condition will be parsed into `Predicate`,
which are stored in an `List`.
*Pros*: Easier to manage each single `Predicate` as they are kept separate
*Cons*: Need to rework existing GUI implementation for `filter` as it only
uses a single `Predicate` Object
| Each user input will be parsed into a `Predicate` object, and all the
`Predicate` formed will be composed into a single `Predicate` object.
*Pros*: Ease of existing and future implementations as functionality only
depends on `Predicate`
*Cons*: Unable to specify actions for each `Predicate`

| Implementation
| User inputs are first parsed into `Predicate` equivalents,
and then added to an `ArrayList`. `FilterCommandParser` then takes the
existing `UniqueHealthWorkerList`, checks for `HealthWorker` whose fields
matches the list of `Predicate` using `allMatch` method from the `Predicate`
library, and then returns an `ObservableList` containing those `HealthWorker`.
| User inputs are parsed into `Predicate` equivalents, which are then composed
into a single `Predicate` containing the logic of all the composed
`Predicates` using the `and` method from `Predicate` library. The composed
`Predicate` is then set as the filter condition into the existing
`ObservableList` of `HealthWorker` in the UI component.

|=======================================================================
// end::filterHealthWorkerTable[]

Ultimately, the decision was made to implement the `filter` command by
composing the `Predicate` that were formed from the user inputs into a single
 `Predicate` using a combination of Java's `Function` library methods
 `stream` and `reduce`, as well as the `and` method used in Java's
 `Predicate` library. +
This is because maintain a `List` of `Predicate` in HealthHub requires an
unnecessary rework of many existing components in HealthHub in order to fit
the new implementation of using a `List`, such as replacing `Predicate` in
methods involved with `List<Predicate>`.

In addition, by returning a single `Predicate` object, ease of implementation
 of methods in `filter` command, as well as any future or existing
 enhancements to `filter` reduces the complexity of code as the function
 needs only to depend on `Predicate` and not `List`, hence observing the Law
 of Demeter.

===== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of events when the `filter h
s/physio` command is entered by the user to display only `HealthWorker`
objects that possess expertise in physiotherapy:

image::FilterHealthWorkerSD.png[width=800]
Figure 3.6.1.1: Sequence diagram illustrating the interactions between the
`Logic` and `Model` components when `filter` command is called.

. When the user inputs the full command `filter h s/physio`, the
`LogicManager` object takes in the command string, and passes it into
`HealthHubParser` using the `parseCommand` method.
. `HealthHubParser` identifies the command word in the input string, which is
 `filter`, and identifies the appropriate `CommandParser` object to parse the
  user command.
. `HealthHubParser` strips the `filter` command word off the user input, and
passes the remaining argument string in to a new `FilterCommandParser` object
 as corresponding to the `filter` command word.
. `FilterCommandParser` then checks for a valid `CommandMode` that
corresponds to the first keyword in the argument string. In this case, the
keyword `h` corresponds to the `CommandMode.HEALTHWORKER` value.
`FilterCommandParser` then creates a `FilterHealthWorkerCommand` with the
`Predicate` constructed from the fields remaining in the argument string. For
 full detail on the implementation of the `FilterCommandParser` logic, see
 the sequence diagram in figure 3.6.1.2 below.
. `FilterCommandParser` returns the `FilterHealthWorkerCommand` object to
`HealthHubParser`, which calls the `execute` method of
`FilterHealthWorkerCommand`.
. `FilterHealthWorkerCommand` uses Java 8's `Predicate` and `Function`
libraries to condense all the supplied `List<Predicate>` into a single
`Predicate` using the `and`, `reduce` and `stream` method calls. After which,
 it calls the `updateFilteredHealthWorker` method in `Model` to set the
 condensed `Predicate` on the `UniqueHealthWorkerBook` in `Model`, displaying
  only the `HealthWorker` that evaluates the set `Predicate` to true on the GUI.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBook`.
There are two extensions of it. `VersionedHealthWorkerBook` extends `HealthWorkerBook` and `VersionedRequestBook` extends `RequestBook`.
Both contain an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `healthWorkerBookStateList` or `requestBookStateList`
 and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBook#commit()` -- Saves the current request/healthworker book state in its history.
* `VersionedBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous request/healthworker book state from its history.
* `VersionedBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone request/healthworker book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()`
and `Model#redo()` respectively.


The feature also makes use `ModifyCommandHistory` to keep track of the commands that modified the books. It contains
`currentStatePointer` and a list of `CommandType` enums to differenciate the type of command to undo or redo.
Similar to `CommandMode`, the various `CommandType` enums are:

** `CommandType.HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND`
** `CommandType.REQUEST_COMMAND`
** `CommandType.HEALTHWORKER_AND_REQUEST_COMMAND`


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedRequestBook` and `VersionedHealthWorkerBook` will be initialized with the initial state,
 and the `currentStatePointer` for each `VersionedBook` pointing to that single book state.
Since no modify command has been called, the initial list of commands in `ModifyCommandHistory` is empty and the initial `currentStatePointer` of `ModifyCommandHistory` is initialized to -1.

image::initrb.png[width="800"]
image::inithb.png[width="800"]


Step 2. The user executes `delete r 5` command to delete the 5th request in request book. The `delete r` command calls `Model#commit(REQUEST_COMMAND)`, causing the modified state of the request book after the `delete r 5` command executes to be saved in the `requestBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted request book state.
Since the request book is modified, the enum `REQUEST_COMMAND` is added to the `modifyCommandHistory` list within the `ModifyCommandHistory` class and the `currentStatePointer` is now pointing at the most recent command.
The `VersionedHealthWorkerBook` is unaffected.

image::rbafterdelete.png[width="800"]
image::mchafterdelete.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add h n/David ...` to add a new healthworker. The `add h` command also calls `Model#commit(HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND)`, causing a modified health worker book state to be saved into the `healthWorkerBookStateList` and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the new health worker book state.
The enum `HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND` is added into the `modifyCommandHistory` list of the `ModifyCommandHistory` class.
The `VersionedRequestBook` is unaffected.

image::hbafteradd.png[width="800"]
image::mchafteradd.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit()`, so the book state will not be saved into the `healthWorkerBookStateList` or `requestBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the health worker was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will first obtain the type of command that needs to be undone by caling  `ModifyCommandHistory#getUndoCommand()`. In this case `HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND` is returned, and hence will call undo on `VersionedHealthWorkerBook`. It will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous health worker book state, and restores the health worker book to that state.
The `currentStatePointer` of the `ModifyCommandHistory` also gets shifted once to the left, pointing it to the previous command.

image::hbafterundo.png[width="800"]
image::mchafterundo.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` of both `VersionedHealthWorkerBook` and `VersionedRequestBook` is at index 0, pointing to the initial book state for both books, then there are no previous states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

[NOTE]
As of version 1.4, the only command that has modifies both the health worker book and the request book is `EditHealthWorkerCommand`.
It is the only command that has `CommandType.HEALTHWORKER_AND_REQUEST_COMMAND`.



The user first enters the `undo` command in the command line interface. The logic manager processes the command as a string
and checks using the `AddressBookParser` is the string is a valid command. In this case, the parser sees that the command string
matches the `undo` command string and hence returns an `undo` command to the `LogicManager` which then calls `execute()` to execute the command.
The `execute()` method calls `Model#undo()` in which the model checks the `ModifyCommandHistory` for the correct `VersionedBook` that needs to be undone
and then calls `VersionedBook#undo()`. Upon a successful undo, the `UndoCommand` will return a successful result to the `LogicManager`
which will then the "Undo Success!" message will be displayed on the command line interface.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSeqDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redo()`, which first obtains the command type by calling `ModifyCommandHistory#getRedoCommand()` and based on the returned command type it shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the respective book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` of both `VersionedBook` s are pointing to the latest state, then there are no undone book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list r`. Commands that do not modify the books, such as `list r`,
will not call `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `VersionedBook` s and `ModyfiCommandHistory` do not change.

image::rbafterlist.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `delete h 1`, which calls `Model#commit(HEALTHWORKER_COMMAND)`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `healthWorkerBookStateList`, all health worker book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations


===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes
[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Implementation |Saves the entire book (Current implementation) | Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
|Pros| Less prone to bugs since the we are switching between different versions of the books. | Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
|Cons| May have performance issues in terms of memory usage especially for
large numbers of health workers and requests.| Every command will have their own implementation of undo and some of them are slow hence it causes performance issues.
(e.g. for `clr`, all requests that were deleted have to be added back into the list, which will be quite slow if
there is a large number of requests).|
|=======================================================================


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Implementation | Use a list to store the history of book states.(Current implementation) | Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
|Pros| Undo and redo commands runs faster since it only involves the switching of the state pointer.| Supports multiple books with the `HistoryManager` alone since we are undoing from the command history.
|Cons| Need multiple `VersionedBook` s. One or each type of book.|  `HistoryManager` keeps a record of all commands, even if they are invalid or commands that does not call `Model#commit()`.
Traversing these irrelevant commands to find the next undoable command will take a long time especially if size of history is large.|
|=======================================================================

===== Aspect: Data structure to handle multiple `VersionedBooks`
[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Implementation | Use a command history to keep track
of the type of book that was modified It is represented as a list of `CommandType`.(Current implementation) | Use a list of pairs. Each state is represented as a pair which stores the `currentStatePointer` of each book.
|Pros| Easily scalable to include more than two books. As the developer can simply add an extra `CommandType`
and extra cases for switch statements.| Supports commands that change multiple books at once since it keeps track of all states.
|Cons| Unable to scale as well if there are many commands that modifies multiple books at once.| Keeping multiple integers takes up more memory as compared to keeping a single enum.
|=======================================================================

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::setreminder[]
=== Set Reminder Feature

The `setreminder` command gives the user an option to set a reminder with a customised message.
The reminder is in the form of an `AlertDialog` and is scheduled to display on the UI by a `TimerTask` at time
`t + current time`, where `t` is time in the format `hh:mm:ss`. +

==== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence flow from when the `SetReminderCommandParser` receives the command and
parses it into a `SetReminderCommand` object.

image::SetReminderSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.9.1 shows the sequence diagram for the different method invocation calls between the classes
// end::setreminder[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics Feature

The statistics mechanism is facilitated by Statistics class, which is a public Java class containing a private static
TreeMap data structure and a private static LinkedHashMap data structure. The TreeMap contains key-value pairs, with the
names of health conditions as keys and the number of occurrences of each health condition as corresponding values. The
key-value pairs in the TreeMap are ordered in lexicographical order, whereas the LinkedHashMap is ordered in descending
order by value.

The statistics feature is called every time the user decides to use any request-related commands (such as `add request`,
`edit r`, `delete r`, `undo`, `redo`, `clr`) since statistics need to keep track of every change in the frequency of all health
conditions. Therefore, the Statistics class also carries out the following operations:

•	updateStatistics(): updates statistics with new health condition-related data after add or edit commands are called
by the user.
•	deleteStatistics(): updates statistics by specifically removing the health condition-related data that need to be
removed after the user calls the delete function.
•	sortStatistics(): sorts statistics by value in descending order of the number of occurrences of each health
conditions, and puts the ordered key-value pairs into sortedMap
•	undoRedoStatistics(): clears statistics and sortedMap completely and uses an ObservableList of all requests in the
request book to extract all the health conditions and their related number of occurrences. These health conditions and
their statistics are then added back to statistics and sortedMap
•	clearStatistics(): renders both statistics and sortedMap empty after the user calls for the clr operation
•	getConditionStatistics(): when the user specifically wants to know the number of occurrences for a particular health
condition

Given below is an example of a usage scenario and how the statistics command is executed at each step:

1.	Starting up HealthHub: The user launches HealthHub for the first time. The `statistics` and `sortedMap` will be
initialized as an empty TreeMap and an empty LinkedHashMap respectively.

2.	Issuing Add Request Command: The user executes `add request n/John Doe i/S8974421C p/98765432 a/123 Brick Road,
#01-01 dt/01-01-2019 14:50:00 c/Diabetes c/Physiotherapy` command to add John Doe to the request book. The
aforementioned command also calls updateStatistics(), which takes in a Set<Condition> containing Diabetes Condition and
Physiotherapy Condition, and adds an occurrence of one each to  statistics. sortStatistics() is then subsequently called
to order the health conditions by value in sortedMap.

3.	Issuing Edit Request Command: The user executes `edit r 1 c/Diabetes` command to make changes to the first request
on the request panel in HealthHub. The aforementioned command also calls deleteStatistics(), which removes the
statistics of health conditions of the first request in  statistics. updateStatistics() is then subsequently called to
add the new health condition (which in this case is just Diabetes) to statistics.  sortStatistics() is lastly called to
order the health conditions by value in sortedMap.
4.	Issuing Undo Request Command: The user executes `undo` command to reverse his earlier `edit r 1 c/Diabetes` command.
The aforementioned commands calls undoRedoStatistics(). This method first clears statistics and sortedMap, and then
takes an ObservableList of all requests from the request book. All health conditions are retrieved from the requests,
and are used to update statistics and sortedMap.

The following sequence shows how the statistics operation works when called by LogicManager:

image::statistics_command_sequence.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a HealthHub user executes a new command:

image::statistics_activity_diagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect
| Alternative 1
| Alternative 2

| Choice of data structure for statistics and sortedMap
| statistics: use TreeMap

  sortedMap: use LinkedHashMap

*Advantages*:

1.	Very fast retrieval of information with the TreeMap; guaranteed O(lgn) time complexity for containsKey, get, put,
remove operations.

2.	TreeMap entries are sorted in the natural ordering of its keys.

3.	Having 2 separate data structures (1 to contain alphabetically arranged health conditions and 1 to contain sorted
conditions by value) aids in the quicker retrieval of data


*Disadvantages*:

1.	Space costly to have 2 separate data structures containing the same information but in different orders

| Use any other reasonable data structure like an ArrayList or a LinkedList

*Advantages*:

1.	Very easy to implement and understand

2.	Space-efficient to have only 1 list of health conditions and their corresponding number of occurrences

*Disadvantages*:

1.	Will need to create another wrapper class around Conditions and their number of occurrences since lists do not allow
for key-value pairing

2.	Retrieval of information for common operations like getting statistics for a particular condition may not be very
fast

|=======================================================================

Decision to go with Alternative 1: The team prioritized speed over space since in hospitals, should they want to
implement HealthHub, will not have an issue with having memory constraints. But they would definitely want to retrieve
data as fast as possible. Moreover, Alternative 1 seems far more scalable for future developments

[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect
| Alternative 1
| Alternative 2

| How `statistics` executes
| The system saves an internal copy of statistics in its storage like a StatisticsBook, modelled after RequestBook or
HealthWorkerBook

*Advantages*:

  1.	When HealthHub is closed and reopened, the old statistics will still exist.

*Disadvantages*:

  1.	Takes up memory space since statistics will now need to be stored as .json files

  2.	Speed of retrieval will be lower since HealthHub will need to dig into its storage for data

| Make the statistics class a static class.

*Advantages*:

1.	Easier to implement; entirely removes the need for making storage files

2.	Speed of retrieval of data will be faster since it does not constantly need to keep digging into storage files

*Disadvantages*:

1.	When HealthHub is closed and reopened, the old statistics will disappear since they have not been stored.

|=======================================================================

Decision to go with Alternative 2:  Since RequestBook was already being stored in the storage component of HealthHub,
I found it redundant and space-inefficient to have to create another StatisticsBook to store statistical data, since all
of my statistical information can be found from the requests stored in RequestBook. I made sure that whenever
request-related commands were being executed (add, edit, delete, undo, redo, clr) statistics was also being updated in
tandem so that the statistical data was always accurate in real-time.

To address the issue of losing statistical data upon closing down and reopening HealthHub, I have ensured that
statistics and sortedMap are initialized with latest data from the RequestBook during the init() method in the MainApp.

// end::statistics[]


// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete Feature for CommandBox
The UI component, `CommandBox`, comes with a `TextField` component in AB4. For Health Hub, the `TextField` is replaced
with an `AutoCompleteTextField` class that extends from the parent class, `TextField`.

In the `AutoCompleteTextField` class, it adds an additional listener to the `textProperty()` of `TextField` class, to register for when
a text input is being sensed and generates the suggestion box in the form of a `ContextMenu` to the user.

image::AutoCompleteTextFieldSMD.png[]
Figure 3.11.1 shows the state machine diagram for the `AutoCompleteTextField` behaviour when it listens for a user input.

The searching of which commands to display to the user as suggestions is done by iterating the `suggestions` data structure, which is a `TreeSet`, then checking
against the user's input if any of the suggestions starts with the user's text.

==== Aspect: Data structure to store the list of commands
[width="100%",cols="1, 5, 5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
Implementation | Use a `TreeSet` datastructure | Use a `SuffixTree` datastructure
|Pros| Implements the `NavigatableSet` interface and guarantees that elements are stored in sorted order, also allows for _O(log n)_ time complexity for dynamic searching of elements  | Made for features like autocompletion, allows particularly fast implementation of `String` operations
|Cons| _none at the moment_ | difficult to comprehend and implement

== Logging
We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

Testing is an important component of the development pipeline for HealthHub.
With each new feature that is implemented, new tests for the fresh feature
must also be included to ensure robustness and validation of the feature. In
addition, regression testing using existing tests already implemented is also
 extensively done to ensure that the application functions without unintended
  side effects. In following sections, we will be elaborating on how you can
  adopt the testing suite implementation that is in place in HealthHub.

=== Running Tests

For the testing phase in HealthHub, we will be using a testing framework
called *JUnit* that is specialised to run tests for software built in Java.

[NOTE]
====
Not sure how JUnit works? Head over to the JUnit website and take a look at
their User Guide at this link:
https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/
====

There are three ways to run tests in HealthHub.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`

=== Generation of test files

We use classes located in the `seedu.address.jsonfilegenerator` folder to generate JSON
test files. +
Developers are free to modify the code within the classes to generate healthworker/request
book containing the respective data they need for tests by using the `HealthWorkerBuilder`
 and `RequestBuilder` classes +
All test file generator classes contains a main function and hence can be ran independently by compiling the file.


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

As HealthHub grows larger as a software development project due to addition
of new features or overhauling of existing ones, we have also deployed the
use of various build automation tools in order to efficiently integrate the
components of HealthHub together during the build process. This allows of
greater efficiency and scalability when introducing new implementations into
the project.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build
automation on your local machine for efficient project builds.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor
.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects to allow
for more seamless and parallel coding performance between team members. See
<<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

Coverage represents the portion of the software codebase that has been tested
 for using various testing frameworks, such as JUnit. This allows the
 development to track how extensive the testing of new features are to ensure
  that their features are correctly implemented with minimal bugs.

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

With a huge number of different components in HealthHub, the project also
includes use of various third party libraries to efficiently support new and
existing features in HealthHub, some of which includes for example the
https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* Administrative staff in hospitals and healthcare organizations that also
manage requests from and services for home-care patients
* Administrative staff that are comfortable with typing on a CLI, as well as
a GUI.
* Aims to streamline the performance of keeping records of home-care
patients, and also assigning health staff to requests using technological
means.

*Value proposition*: manage requests from home-care patients, and handle
assignment of healthstaff for these requests much faster and efficient than
traditional methods of pen and paper documentation.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

In case of circumstances where manual testing needs to be done for HealthHub,
 this section provides instructions on how to get started on manual testing
 for the application.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.



=== Adding a `HealthWorker

* Enter a valid `add healthworker` command with all compulsory fields
containing valid values. For example, you may try `add healthworker n/Dog Terr
p/92837710 i/S98817471Z o/NUH s/GENERAL_PRACTICE s/ORTHOPAEDIC` +
 Message showing the successful addition of the `HealthWorker` will be
displayed in the command terminal, as well as the details of the newly added
`HealthWorker`. The newly added `HealthWorker` is now reflected immediately
in the GUI shown at the end of the list on the right.
* Enter an invalid `add healthworker` command. Some examples include:
** Missing fields: add healthworker p/92837710 i/S98817471Z o/NUH
s/GENERAL_PRACTICE s/ORTHOPAEDIC` (Missing name) +
An error message representing invalid command format will be displayed on the
 command terminal, as well as the valid command format for the `add
 healthworker` command.

** Invalid fields: add healthworker n/Dog Terr p/92837710 i/A111Z o/NUH
s/GENERAL_PRACTICE s/ORTHOPAEDIC` (Invalid NRIC format) +
An error message is displayed that tells the user of the incorrect format for
 a field whose value does not follow the correct format. If there are
 multiple, the incorrect format of the first field whose value is invalid is
 shown.

=== Editing a `HealthWorker`

* Enter a valid `edit healthworker` command with a valid index, and at least
one field to edit with a valid value. For example, you may try `edit
healthworker 1 p/91234567 n/John Doe` +
A status message that denotes the successful modification of the details of
an existing `HealthWorker` is shown on the command terminal. In addition, the
 modified details of the `HealthWorker is immediately reflected on the list
 in the GUI.

* Enter an invalid `edit healthworker` command. Some examples include:
** Invalid index: `edit healthworker -1 n/John` +
An error message displays which informs the user that the index provided is
invalid.
** No field specified: `edit healthworker 1 ` +
An error message displays informing the user that at least one field to edit
must be provided.
** Invalid field: `edit healthworker 1 p/helloworld` +
An error message displays informing the user that the specific field
specified containing invalid values does not conform the field format. If
multiple invalid fields are entered, the first invalid one will be chosen as
the invalid format.

=== Deleting a `HealthWorker`

* Deleting a `HealthWorker` while all `HealthWorker` are listed:

.. Prerequisites: List all `HealthWorker` using the `list healthworker`
command. Multiple `HealthWorker` in the list.
.. Test case: `delete healthworker 1` +
   Expected: First `HealthWorker` is deleted from the list. Details of the
   deleted `HealthWorker` shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status
   bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete healthworker 0` +
   Expected: No `HealthWorker` is deleted. Error details shown in the status
   message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, delete healthworker`,
`delete healthworker x` (where x is larger than the list size), `delete healthworker y` (where y is negative) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

* Deleting a `HealthWorker` after a valid `filter healthworker` command is
issued:
.. Prerequisite: Enter the command `filter healthworker s/physiotherapy` to
display only `HealthWorker` that specialise in physiotherapy. Other valid
variants of the `filter healthworker` command may be used in place of this.
.. Test case: `delete healthworker 1` +
   Expected: First `HealthWorker` is deleted from the filtered list. Details of
    the deleted `HealthWorker` shown in the status message. Timestamp in the
    status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete healthworker 0` +
   Expected: No `HealthWorker` is deleted. Error details shown in the status
   message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, delete healthworker`,
`delete healthworker x` (where x is larger than the filtered list size),
`delete healthworker y` (where y is negative) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files
.. If data file is missing, the app will retrieve a list of sample data internally. It will be saved upon exit.
.. If any of the data is corrupted, the app will start with empty books, adding a health worker
or request will overwrite the corrupted file.

// tag::undoredo[]

=== Undoing a command
. Undo a command that has been executed
.. Prerequisites: A command that modifies the data has been executed already, for example `delete r 1`.
.. Test case: `undo` +
Expected: The request has been deleted will appear back inside the list in its original position.
.. Test case: `undo` without any prerequisites +
Expected: The application will show an error message: No more commands to undo!

=== Redoing a command
. Redo an undone command
.. Prerequisites: A successful undo command have to be executed already.
.. Test case: `redo` +
Expected: The application will redo the undone command.
.. Test case: `redo` without prerequisites +
Expected: The application will show an error message: No more commands to redo!
