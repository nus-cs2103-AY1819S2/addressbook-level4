=== Patient Management
The Patient Management module features commands involving the registration, update, searching
and removal of patient records in QuickDocs.

Using just a few keystrokes, you can manage your patient records in a more organized and efficient manner.

'''

[[addpat, Add patient]]
==== Adding patient: `addpat`

You can register new patients and start storing their records in QuickDocs using the `addpat` command.

Patient details that can be stored include: name, NRIC, email, address, gender, date of birth, contact number.

[TIP]
You can add a tag to a patient to indicate his or her long term illnesses. You can add multiple tags to the patient to ease searching. +

{sp}+

*Format:* `addpat n/NAME r/NRIC e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS g/GENDER d/DATE OF BIRTH c/CONTACT  [t/tag]...` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `ap`
[TIP]
The order of input does not matter as long as all the necessary fields are captured. +

{sp}+

*Examples:*

* `addpat n/Gary Goh r/S7332803I g/M d/1973-04-01 a/20 Upper Changi Road c/92347654 e/ggoh@gmail.com t/highbloodpressure t/diabetes`

* `addpat n/Chan Mei Hua r/S8865281I d/1998-05-09 g/F c/92341221 a/2 Simei Street e/cmh@gmail.com`

{sp}+
*Result:*

After entering the `addpat` command, QuickDocs will show the details of the recently added patient on the
main display as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.The main display after addpat command
image::ap_after.png[width="600"]

'''

[[editpat, Edit patient]]
==== Editing patient : `editpat`

If you made a mistake when registering a patient, fret not! You can always make changes to the patient record with the `editpat` command.
All the fields in the record can be edited, including the NRIC and tags.

[NOTE]
The tags entered during an edit patient command will override all the tags a patient record currently possess.

{sp} +
*Format:* `editpat NRIC [n/NAME] [a/Address] [r/NRIC] …` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `ep` +

[NOTE]
The first NRIC to specify the record does not require a prefix. +
The prefixes used for the `editpat command` is the same as the ones used in the <<addpat>> section. +

{sp} +

*Example:* +

* `editpat S7332803I n/Gary Doh e/gdoh@gmail.com`  +
This changes the email and name of the patient with NRIC: S7332803I to Gary Doh and gdoh@gmail.com respectively.

{sp} +
*Result:* +

After the `editpat` is performed, you can view the changes made to the patient record in the main display.

image::ep_after.png[width="600"]

{sp} +
Since every citizen, permanent residents or foreigners in Singapore have their unique NRIC / FIN numbers, duplicate NRIC are not
allowed in QuickDocs.

When you edit a patient's NRIC/FIN and there is an existing patient with that NRIC, the current edit
will not be executed. You will also be notified of the detection of duplicated NRIC entries through the input feedback box,
in the manner shown in the following picture.

.Error message shown when QuickDocs detected a duplicate NRIC in the patient records
image::ep_conflict.png[width="600"]

'''

[[listpat, List patients]]
==== List patient details : `listpat`

To view a patient's detail, you can use the `listpat` command. You can search and filter patient records
by their names, NRIC and even their tags.

* QuickDocs only support one filter per search currently.
* If more than one filter is entered (i.e. `listpat n/NAME r/NRIC`, only the first search criteria will be used
(in this case, name)

For example, if you want to check the patient's NRIC, you can always turn to `listpat` to help narrow down your search.
Entering listpat with `r/S92` and QuickDocs will present you with patient records whose NRIC starts with S92.

* You can similarly filter down your search using tags or parts of a patient name in the same manner.
* A specific patient's record can be displayed by calling `listpat` with the full name or full nric

[NOTE]
Each patient record stored within QuickDocs have a record number, known as an *INDEX*. The
Index can also be used to narrow down patient searches to a single record.

{sp} +
*Format:* `listpat [PREFIX / KEYWORD] …` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `lp` +

{sp} +

*Examples and Results:*

* `listpat` +

If no keywords are entered, `listpat` will simply display the first 50 patients record stored.

.executing the listpat command without any matching criteria
image::lp_noargs.png[width="600"]

{sp} +
* `listpat n/P` +

Suppose you want to find a patient record whose name starts with "P", you can use `listpat` along
with a sequence of characters to search for the specific patient record you are interested in.

.Listing patients with matching name
image::lp_name_after.png[width="600"]

{sp} +
* `listpat r/S92` +

You can narrow down your patient search by providing a NRIC sequence as well. For example,
in the figure below, you can retrieve all the patients whose NRIC starts with "S92".

.Listing patients with matching NRIC
image::lp_nric_after.png[width="600"]

{sp} +
After narrowing down your search, you will be able to use the specific NRIC number of a particular patient to view the in-depth
patient particulars.

.Showing specific patient's record using the full NRIC
image::lp_nric_specific.png[width="600"]

{sp} +
* `listpat t/diabetes` +

The tags you assigned to each patient can also be used to expedite the `listpat` command. For example, diabetic patients can be
listed using the `listpat` command along with "t/diabetes" value.'

[NOTE]
Tags specified for the search must be full sequences (i.e. Diabetes, highbloodpressure/, etc). QuickDocs do not
permit partial tag search as of v1.4.

.Listing patients by specific tag
image::lp_tag_after.png[width="600"]

{sp} +
* `listpat 5`

Did you notice that when QuickDocs display multiple patient records during filtering, each record starts with
a number? This is the index of the patient record, indicating the position the record is stored within QuickDoc's patient record storage.

You can make use of the index number to view specific patient records as well.

.Patient search using record index
image::lp_index.png[width="600"]

'''

[[deletepat, Delete patient]]
==== Deleting patient `deletepat`

When a patient is no longer visiting your clinic (i.e. moved residency), you can choose to remove their details from QuickDocs.

{sp} +
*Format:* `deletepat r/NRIC` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `dp` +

{sp} +

*Example:* `deletepat r/S7338031I`

{sp} +
*Result:*

By specifying the NRIC along with the `deletepat` command, you will delete the patient with that specific NRIC. If you have difficulty finding the specific NRIC, you can refer to the <<listpat>> command section to help you retrieve the patient's NRIC.

.Deleting patient records using the specific NRIC
image::dp_after.png[width="600"]

{nbsp} +

'''



=== Consultation Management

With QuickDocs, you no longer need to navigate to different menus just to record symptoms of the patient's illness, or assigning medicine to tackle
the patient's current condition.

Using the Consultation Management module, you can now handle the prescription and diagnosis stages of each consultation session
in one go.

''''

[[consult, Start consultation]]
==== Start consultation: `consult`

After a patient is registered, whenever he or she visits your clinic, you can start recording the diagnosis and medicine prescribed by starting a
consultation session on QuickDocs.

Consultation is started after the NRIC of the patient is provided, you can revisit the <<listpat>> section to help identify the NRIC
of specific patients +

[NOTE]
QuickDocs only permit one ongoing consultation session at any given time. The
<<diagnose>> and <<prescribe>> steps must be completed before a consultation can end. Otherwise
you can always use the <<abort>> command to exit an ongoing session without saving any details recorded.

{sp} +
*Format:* `consult r/NRIC` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `c` +

{sp} +

*Example:*

* `consult r/S9876542C` +

*Result:*

Once you started a consultation session for the patient, a message will be displayed on the main display area to indicate that the consultation session
have started for the current patient.

.Starting a consultation session on QuickDocs
image::consult_after.png[width="600"]

{sp}+
A text indicating that the consultation session have started for the particular patient will also
appear at the bottom right corner of QuickDocs, so that you will be aware that a current consultation session is ongoing even after
subsequent commands.

{sp}+
[NOTE]
While a consultation session is ongoing, It does not mean that you are limited to just entering the consultation commands. You can still enter command that are not within the consultation module (i.e.
 listing patients, checking the medicine inventory, etc).


'''

[[diagnose, Diagnose patient]]
==== Diagnosing a patient: `diagnose`

After the consultation session has began, you can start recording the patient's ailments. The various symptoms the patients have can be recorded down,
along with the final assessment of the illness the patient is currently having.

To complete the diagnosis, the record must have one assessment and at least one symptom.

[NOTE]
This command requires you to have a consultation session already active. See: <<consult>>.

{sp}+
*Format:* `diagnose s/SYMPTOM [s/SYMPTOM] ... a/ASSESSMENT` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `d` +

{sp}+

*Example:*

* `diagnose s/runny nose s/sore throat s/phlegmy cough a/influenza` +

The order of symptoms and assessment does not matter here. You record as many symptoms per diagnosis.

{sp} +
*Results:*

After entering the command, QuickDocs will show the symptoms and assessment recorded on the main display as demonstrated
in the following diagram.

.Result of the diagnose command
image::diagnose_after.png[width="600"]

{sp} +
If you made a mistake when entering the diagnosis, you can always rectify it by re-entering the `diagnose` command with the correct
symptoms and assessment. This will replace the current erroneous diagnosis with the one you have just entered.

.Editing the diagnosis
image::diagnose_edit_after.png[width="600"]

{sp}+
[TIP]
Whenever you make a mistake entering a command, you can always press the UP and DOWN buttons on your keyboard to cycle through the past
commands you have entered into QuickDocs. This allow you to easily navigate to the erroneous command you have entered, make changes and then re-enter
the command again to rectify your errors.

'''

[[prescribe, Prescribe medicine]]
==== Prescribing medicine for a patient: `prescribe`

After you are done recording the symptoms and assessing the illness of the patient, you can start prescribing medicine to your patient.

For each medicine prescribed, the quantity must be specified. Like the <<diagnose>> command, you can always reenter the command to override
the current prescription should there be any errors made.

A minimum of one medicine and one quantity is required to record a prescription entry. The order of quantity entered corresponds to the order of the medicine entered. +

[NOTE]
This command requires you to have a consultation session already active. See: <<consult>>.

[NOTE]
The medicine to be prescribed must be present in the inventory and its quantity must be sufficient for
the assignment during the presciption stage. +
Check out the <<addmed>> section for information on adding medicine to the inventory,
and <<listmed>> section on the steps to check a medicine's amount.

{sp} +
*Format:* `prescribe m/MEDICINE [m/MEDICINE] ... q/QUANTITY [q/QUANTITY]` +
or{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} *:* `prescribe m/MEDICINE q/QUANTITY [m/MEDICINE] [q/QUANTITY] ...` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `p` +

{sp} +

*Example:*

* `prescribe m/penicillin q/1 m/Afrin spray q/1 m/ibuprofen q/2` +
   Prescription now consist of 1 unit of penicillin, 1 unit of afrin spray and 2 units of ibuprofen.

* `prescribe m/penicillin m/Afrin spray m/ibuprofen q/1 q/1 q/2` +
   Same as above example, quantity ordered based on medicine order.

{sp} +
*Results:*

After the medicine-quantity pairings are entered, the prescription to address the patient's current condition will be displayed on the main display area of QuickDocs. Changes can still be made to the prescription as long as the consultation session is still ongoing.

image::prescription_after.png[width="600"]

'''

[[endconsult, End consultation]]
==== End consultation: `endconsult`

Once the diagnosis and prescription are finalized, you can end the consultation with a simple `endconsult` command.
No further changes to the diagnosis and prescription details can be made after this point.

{sp} +
*Format:* `endconsult` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `ec`

{sp} +
*Result:*

Once you entered the `endconsult` command, a message to indicate the end of the consultation session is also shown on the main display area.
The label for the ongoing consultation session is also removed after the command is entered.

Most importantly, the consultation record (diagnosis and prescription) is now stored.

image::endconsult.png[width="600"]

'''

[[abort, Abort consultation]]
==== Aborting a consultation session: `abort`

If you started a consultation session by mistake, or the patient does not seemed to require a consultation,
you can always abort the consultation session without providing the diagnosis and prescription details.

{sp} +
*Format:* `abort` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `ab`

{sp} +
*Result:*

When you enter the `abort` command, a message is also shown on the main display area to indicate that the current session is aborted.
The label for the ongoing consultation session is also removed.

.Results of an abort command

'''

[[listconsult, List consultations]]
==== List consultation: `listconsult`

Whenever you want to revisit a specific consultation record, you can filter it down by the patient before narrowing it down
to the specific session.

You can use QuickDocs to list out all the past consultation sessions of a single patient by first specifying his or her NRIC,
and then view the consultation details by passing in the session's index. +

{sp} +
*Format:* `listconsult INDEX` +
or{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} *:* `listconsult r/NRIC` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `lc` +

{sp} +

*Examples and Results:*

* `listconsult r/S9876542C` +

Specifying the NRIC after the `listconsult` command will display a list of consultation records belonging to
the patient with the specified NRIC.

Note that the indexes are prepended on each of the past consultation records listed.

.Displaying past visits of a particular patient
image::listconsult_after.png[width="600"]

{sp}+

* `listconsult 1` +

image::listconsult_index.png[width="600"]

You can then call `listconsult` again with the consultation record's index to view the specific consultation session details. QuickDocs will display the time of the consultation, and also the diagnosis and prescription given to the patient.

'''

=== Medicine Management
You can manage your medicine storage all by your wishes! QuickDocs allows you to organise your medicines in a directory format much like the folders in Windows OS! +

You can design and name your directories by functionalities, pricing, classifications or anything in your mind! +

Initially, the medicine storage only contains one root directory named as "root" by default. All the rest is then up to you to decide!

[TIP]
Through QuickDocs, you could place the same medicine under different directories. For example, medicine paracetamol could be placed under "fever" and "headache" simultaneously. +
[TIP]
Following the same logic, you may not be able to store two different medicine with the same name in QuickDocs. All instances of medicine with the same name will refer to the same medicine.

- - -

==== Suggestion mode in command typing

In QuickDocs, as medicines are stored in directories format, you will need to key in the path to your interested directory/medicine from time to time. +

For your convenience, QuickDocs actually provides a quick cut to key in these paths so that you do not need to type in every character by yourself! +

As long as you are typing a command in medicine module and you have typed the name of the first parent directory followed by a `\` character, the suggestion mode is automatically turn on! +

So what is suggestions mode? Why is that useful? The following example will illustrate the convenience it brings to you.

* Suppose you have a directory 'Flu' under directory 'General' under directory 'Internal' under the root directory 'root' as illustrated below:

[[suggestion_ug1]]
.Display of detailed information
image::suggestion_ug1.png[width='600']

* Now you want to type this command `listmed root\Internal\General\Flu` , which is a command to see detailed information about that directory, from scratch.

* What you can do is to first type `listmed root\` to trigger the suggestion mode.

.To trigger the suggestion mode
image::suggestion_ug2.png[width='600']

* You can then press the page-down key to iterate through all subdirectories under 'root'. The input box will automatically be filled for you.

.After pressing Page Down once
image::suggestion_ug3.png[width='600']

* In this example, you can arrive at `listmed root\Internal` in just two Page Down keys.

.After pressing Page Down twice
image::suggestion_ug4.png[width='600']

* Doing this recursively at every stage, you can quickly arrive at the desired `listmed root\Internal\General\Flu`.

* Suppose now you want to view the detailed information about a medicine called 'guaifenesin' under directory 'Flu'. You entered `listmed root\Internal\General\Flu\guai` only to realize that you forget the spelling of guaifenesin.

* Do not worry! You can press page-up / page-down as well. Page up will bring you to the last valid sub-directory / medicine name as compared to your input according to alphabetic order. Page down will bring you to the next valid input.

.Before pressing Page Up / Page Down
image::suggestion_ug5.png[width='600']

.After pressiong Page Up, brings you to the last valid medicine: diphenhydramine
image::suggestion_ug6.png[width='600']

.After pressing Page Down, brings you to your desired : guaifenesin
image::suggestion_ug7.png[width='600']

{nbsp} +

In short, instead of typing out every characters, you can iterate through your directories fast and easy when typing commands using the page-up and page-down keys!

[NOTE]
In QuickDocs, names of directories and medicines are case-insensitive. So what appears in the suggestions may be in different cases from the actual name, but they will work the same.

- - -

[[adddirec, Add directory]]
==== Add new directory into storage: `adddirec`

By providing the path pointing to a specific directory, you can add a new directory under that directory. +

The new directory will be an empty directory whose name is up to you to decide.

[NOTE]
The new directory's name should not contain white spaces or "\" characters.

{sp} +
*Format:* `adddirec [PATH OF THE PARENT DIRECORY] [NAME OF NEW DIRECTORY]` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `ad`

{sp} +

*Example:* +

* `adddirec root fever` followed by `adddirec root\fever oral` +

*Result:* +

These commands add a new directory called fever to root, and then add another new directory called oral under fever. +

There will be success messages confirming every successful addition of directories. +

[[addmed, Add medicine]]
==== Add medicine into storage: `addmed`

Through this command, you can either add a new medicine into the storage, or to place an existing medicine under another directory. +

{sp} +

You can add a new medicine by specifying where it should go to, its initial quantity and its price +

*Format:* `addmed [PATH OF DIRECTORY TO ADD TO] [MEDICINE_NAME] [q/QUANTITY] [p/PRICE]` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `am`

[NOTE]
Directories and medicines under the same directory are now allowed to share the same name (case-insensitive).

{sp} +

*Example:* +

`addmed root\fever paracetamol q/50 p/9.99`

*Result:* +

After you enter the command, if it is executed successfully, a confirmation message will appear.

[[addmed_newMedicine_existing]]
.Error message of adding an existing medicine in wrong format
image::addmed_newMedicine_existing.png[width="600"]

{sp} +

You can also place an existing medicine into a directory. +

*Format:* `addmed [PATH] [MEDICINE_NAME]`

{sp} +

*Example:* +

`addmed root\headache paracetamol` +

Assuming there already exists a medicine called paracetamol in the storage, you can place this medicine under root\headache via this command. +

*Result:* +

After you enter the command, if it is executed successfully, a confirmation message showing the detailed information of that medicine will appear.

[[addmed_existing]]
.Success message of sample addmed command

[[alarm, Set alert threshold for medicine]]
==== Setting automatic notification for low stock: `alarm`

To further ease your management of the clinic, QuickDocs could automatically alert you should any of your medicine is running low in storage! +

All you need to do is to set an alarm level for the medicine you are concerned with. +

[TIP]
In addition, QuickDocs can make your life even easier! You can set an alarm level for a directory so that every medicine placed under that directory and all its sub-directories will immediately have that alarm level.

{sp} +

*Format:* `alarm [PATH OF DIRECTORY OR MEDICINE]` +

{sp} +

*Example:*

`alarm root\fever 60`

{sp} +

*Result:*

As the path points to a medicine, the sample command set the alarm level for aspirin to 60. +

As the storage only has 50 units of aspirin, a reminder is shown on the right.

[[alarm_medicine_after]]
.Response for the sample alarm command
image::alarm_medicine_after.png[width='600']

{sp} +

*Example:*

`alarm root\high_blood_pressure\aspirin`

{sp} +

*Result:*

As the path points to a directory, the sample command set the alarm level for all medicine under "fever" directory and all its subdirectories to 60. +

As the medicine paracetamol under "fever" has only 50 units, which is below the limit, a reminder is shown on the right.

[[buymed, Buy a medicine]]
==== Recording purchases of medicine: `buymed`

As a doctor running your own clinic, you will certainly purchase medicine from time to time to keep your medicine storage updated. +

This command allows you to record every purchase you made in the simplest way! +

[TIP]
You can access the medicine via two ways. You can either provide the full path to the medicine, or provide the name of medicine only.

*Format:* `buymed [MEDICINE_NAME] [AMOUNT] [UNIT_COST]` +
or{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} *:* `buymed [PATH_OF_MEDICINE] [AMOUNT] [UNIT_COST]`

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `bm`

{sp} +

*Example:*

`buymed aspirin 20 4.3` +

{sp} +

*Result:*

Using this command, you update the amount of aspirin in the storage form 34 to 54. +

As the amount of aspirin now exceed the minimum threshold set, which is 50, the reminder for low storage automatically disappears. +

The following figures illustrates the states of QuickDocs before and after you executing that command.

[[setprice, Set price for a medicine]]
==== Setting Price for a medicine: `setprice`

Through QuickDocs, you have hundred percent freedom to set the price of your medicine via this simple command! +

The price you set will be used in your prescriptions.

[TIP]
Similar to buymed command, you can either provide the full path to your interested medicine or the name of it only.

=== Appointments and Reminders
The Appointment and Reminder module give you more control over your busy schedule, featuring commands such as adding, removing,
and searching appointments and reminders. There is also a command to list out all free appointment timings to help you choose
your appointment timings more wisely.

You will never forget about any appointments or tasks again! +

'''
[[addapp]]
==== Adding appointments: `addapp`
After a consultation session, you may want to schedule a follow-up appointment with your patient. You can do so
with `addapp` to create an appointment with an existing patient in QuickDocs to add to your schedule.

[TIP]
The `<<freeapp, freeapp>>` command may be useful for you to first list out all free appointment timings for a given range of dates
before choosing an appropriate appointment timing!

[NOTE]
To ensure that you do not forget about any future appointments, QuickDocs will automatically create a reminder for
the added appointment. You may not notice this reminder as it will only appear on your reminder sidebar closer to the date
of the actual appointment (on the week of the appointment date).

{sp} +
*Format:* `addapp r/NRIC d/DATE s/START e/END c/COMMENT` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `aa` +

[NOTE]
The format for a valid date is strictly `YYYY-MM-DD` (including the dashes) and a valid time is strictly `HH:MM` (including the colon).
If unsure, you may refer to the example below.

{sp} +
*Example and results:*

* `addapp r/S6394980I d/2019-07-23 s/16:00 e/17:00 c/Weekly checkup` +

This adds an appointment allocated to the patient with NRIC S6394980I, on 23rd July 2019, from 4pm to 5pm. You can
include any comments or notes you want to this appointment, which is 'Weekly checkup' in this case.

If the addition of the appointment was successful, QuickDocs will show the details of the added appointment on the
main display as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.The main display after adding an appointment
image::ug-app_rem/addapp_success.png[width="600"]

{sp} +

The addition of the appointment could have failed as there is a conflict in timing with another existing appointment.
QuickDocs will display a message in the input feedback box notifying you of this error, as demonstrated in the diagram below.

.Adding an appointment that has conflicting timing with an existing appointment
image::ug-app_rem/addapp_clash.png[width="600"]
{sp} +


Another reason for failing to add an appointment could be due to the appointment timing being outside of office hours
which is from 9am to 6pm. QuickDocs will alert you of this error, as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.Adding an appointment that is not within the office hours, from 9am to 6pm
image::ug-app_rem/addapp_officehour.png[width="600"]

'''
[[listapp]]
==== Listing appointments: `listapp`
You can list all past and future appointments that you have added using the `listapp` command. The appointments will be ordered and
listed, with the earliest appointment at the top and the latest at the bottom. You can filter the appointments
you want to see either by specifying a `FORMAT` and a `DATE`, or by specifying an existing patient's `NRIC`.

{sp} +
*Format:* `listapp f/FORMAT d/DATE` +
or{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} *:* `listapp r/NRIC` +
*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `la` +

[NOTE]
The valid keywords for `FORMAT` are only `day`, `week`, or `month`.

{sp} +
*Examples:*

* `listapp` +

By default, `listapp` will list all appointments scheduled in the current week if there are no keywords provided. +
{sp} +

* `listapp f/day d/2019-07-23` +

Lists all appointments scheduled on 23rd July 2019. +
{sp} +

.Listing appointments scheduled on the week of 23rd July 2019.
image::ug-app_rem/listapp_week.png[width="600"]

'''
[[deleteapp]]
==== Deleting appointments: `deleteapp`
If the patient would like to change the appointment date, or if there is a mistake in the appointment details, you can
delete the existing scheduled appointment with `deleteapp` and then create a new appointment.
*Deletion of an appointment is final!*

[NOTE]
QuickDocs will automatically delete the corresponding reminder created for the deleted appointment, if it still exists,
so you don't have to worry about any discrepancies with your reminder sidebar!

{sp} +
*Format:* `deleteapp d/DATE s/START` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `da` +

[NOTE]
Since there cannot be any overlapping appointment timings, you are able to uniquely identify any appointment with
just the `DATE` and `START` time of the appointment.

{sp} +
*Example and results*:

* `deleteapp d/2019-07-23 s/16:00` +

This command will delete the appointment created on 23rd July 2019 with a start time of 4pm, if it exists. If successful,
QuickDocs will display the details of the deleted appointment on the main display, as demonstrated in the diagram below:

.Deleting an existing appointment in QuickDocs successfully

'''
[[freeapp]]
==== List free appointment slots: `freeapp`
[[fa, freeapp]]
Unsure of what appointment timings are available in your schedule? Instead of using `<<listapp, listapp>>` to display all existing
appointments, use `freeapp` instead to display a more intuitive list of free appointment slots -

The free appointment slots will be ordered and listed, with the earliest date at the top and the latest at the bottom.
You can filter the free slots you want to see by specifying a `FORMAT` and a `DATE`.

{sp} +
*Format:* `freeapp f/FORMAT d/DATE` +

Need to take note of a task to do in the future? You can create a reminder for an event or task with `addrem`,
and the reminder will show up on your sidebar closer to the date of the event (the week of the reminder date).
Never forget about your tasks ever again!

{sp} +
*Format:* `addrem t/TITLE d/DATE s/START [e/END] [c/COMMENT]` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `ar` +

[NOTE]
`END` time and `COMMENT` are optional fields for a reminder.

The reminders will be ordered and listed, with the earliest reminder at the top and the latest at the bottom.
You can filter the reminders you want to see by specifying a `FORMAT` and a `DATE`.

[NOTE]
On startup, QuickDocs will automatically display the reminders for the current week on the sidebar.

Are the titles or comments too long to be displayed fully on the sidebar? You can also use `listrem` to display all the
details of a single reminder by specifying its `INDEX` that is shown on the sidebar.

[TIP]
If you are tired of typing, you could also click the reminder
with your mouse and all its details will be displayed as well!

{sp} +
*Format:* `listrem f/FORMAT d/DATE` +
or{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} *:* `listrem i/INDEX` +
*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `lr` +

{sp} +

'''
[[deleterem]]
==== Deleting reminders: `deleterem`
If you would like to clear out your reminder sidebar after a task is completed, you can do so using the `deleterem` command.
Each reminder on the sidebar are identified with an `INDEX`, which you can use to specify the reminder to be deleted.
*Deletion of a reminder is final!*

{sp} +
*Format:* `deleterem INDEX` +

*Alias{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}:* `dr` +

[NOTE]
We do not need to include the `INDEX` prefix, `i/`, as opposed to the `<<listrem, listrem>>` command. This is
because `deleterem` only accepts one parameter, `INDEX`, while `<<listem, listrem>>` can accept more than one.

{sp} +
