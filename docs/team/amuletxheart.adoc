---

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *appointment management features*
** What it does: allows the user to manage appointments between patients and doctors.
** Justification: This is a core feature to allow appointments to be managed in an organized manner.
** Highlights: Appointments can be prone to many issues as it deals with date and time. Therefore, extreme care must be
taken when handling user input to prevent any issues with invalid date and time combinations. Also there are numerous
constraints, such as new appointments can only be created during business hours, be in the future and patients can only
complete their appointments after they are over.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** UI: Enhanced the user interface to include 4 sections, a section to display patients, a section to
display doctors, a section to display medical history, a section to display appointments. Also added the ability to
switch an entire panel to display the current relevant content.
** Model: Utilized the singleton design pattern is synchronize the generation of unique patient and doctor IDs across
the entire application to ensure there are no duplicate IDs.
