== The Project
Our team was tasked with enhancing
https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[this addressbook]
for our Software Engineering Project. We made the decision to morph it into a personalized file manager,
*_PDF{plus}{plus}_*. Inspired by applications that bring an upgrade to the atypical solution like
*_Notepad{plus}{plus}_*, we wanting to make an application relevant for students.
This application allows you to set datelines and tags for files, with managing PDFs as
its main specialty. It is mainly a CLI (Command Line Interface) application i.e. commands are executed
through typing the desired command in the input line provided. However, several commands also allow for
input through a GUI (Graphical User Interface), where the user is able to click on the desired input.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

[.big]#`Grey highlights`# (called mark-ups) indicate that this is a command that
can be executed by the application.

== Summary of Contributions
The following section details a summarised overview of my contributions to the team
project in the areas of coding, documentation and design.

=== Enhancements added:
* [.big]#`merge`# command
** Description: I added the ability to append two of more PDF files within the
application to so that a new file is created with the merged content.
** Justification: Merging PDF files is highly utilised, especially by students or
users handling numerous documentations. However, merging of PDF files is usually a
service provided by paid versions of PDF managers.
** Highlight: Merging can be done quickly through the application, without the
inconvenience of relying on other software and third-party online services to do it.

* [.big]#`move`# command
** Description: I added the ability to move files within the application to any permissible directory
within the user's local device.
** Justification: *_PDF{plus}{plus}_* is intended to be complete replacement for managing files. The user
should be able to perform all the desired actions regarding file management through the application.
** Highlight: When moving a file to a deeply nested directory, it is much more convenient as compared to
manually navigating to the directory to move the file.

.Merge Feature
****
[.big]#*Current Implementation*#

The merge function utilises the
https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi#20x[_Apache PDFBox® library_], specifically the
https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/multipdf/PDFMergerUtility.html[_PDFMergerUtility_]
API to append two or more PDFs and create a new file with the merged content. As there will be one
additional file added to the application, this feature also implicitly performs an `Add` feature to add the new
PDF to the application.

The Merge feature has the following syntax:

`merge` <INDEX1> <INDEX2> ...

* `<INDEX>` refers to the index of the `Pdf` that you wish to merge.
* Minimum of two indices have to be provided for the merge to be performed, up to as many
indices as desired.
* It is possible to repeat an index; the PDF would simply merge with a copy of itself.

[NOTE]
The index value can be referenced from the list in the main application, or from the
result of the `Filter`, `Find` or `List` feature.

[.big]#*Feature breakdown*#

Illustrated below is a sample usage scenario that provides a clear view to the inner
workings of the `merge` feature.

Step 1: From the main interface of the application, the user chooses the file(s) that
they wish to merge, and enters the `merge` command into the CLI Interface, following
the outlined Syntax as illustrated below.

image::MergeFeatureStep1.png[width="600"]

Step 2: After executing the command, the `MergeCommandParser` parses the input into
relevant objects that are required to be executed by the `MergeCommand` object. In
particular, it ensures that there are two or more arguments passed as described in the
above Syntax. Upon parsing, the parser then creates a new `MergeCommand` that will execute
the user's input.

In this case, the above two files will be merged, with the _"CS2103T_PDF++_UG_Intro.pdf"_
file appended behind the other file.

Step 3: The `MergeCommand` is then executed. Successful execution
of the command would return a *CommandResult* object and create the a new file with the merged
content, while unsuccessful execution due to validation failure will throw a *CommandException*.

[NOTE]
The new name of the merged file follows the format: "merged[hashcode].pdf". This is to ensure
unique file name. The hashcode in the name will be modified if name already exists.

.Move Feature
****
[.big]#*Current Implementation*#

The move feature functions as a simplified version of the `Edit` feature, as in nature
it is making an edit to the directory of the file. However, in addition to making changes
to the directory in the application storage, it also ensures that the directory changes
are reflected in the local filesystem.

[NOTE]
The design consideration into separating move as a new command from edit factored in the
purpose of the application; as a document manager, the term "edit" is synonymous with
making content or characteristic changes when it is applied in the context of documents.

The Move feature has the following syntax:

`move`

`move <INDEX> <NEWDIRECTORY>`

* `<INDEX>` refers to the index of the `Pdf` that you wish to move.
* `<NEWDIRECTORY>` refers to the address of the new location the file is to be moved.
* Entering `move` without `<INDEX>` or  `<NEWDIRECTORY>` will open the default file
selection GUI for the user to select the file directly.

[NOTE]
The index value can be referenced from the list in the main application, or from the
result of the `Filter`, `Find` or `List` feature.

All parts of the syntax are required.

[.big]#*Feature breakdown*#

Illustrated below is a sample usage scenario that provides a clear view to the inner
workings of the `move` feature.

Step 1: From the main interface of the application, the user chooses a `Pdf` that
they wish to move, and enters the `move` command into the CLI Interface, following
the outlined Syntax as illustrated below.

image::MoveFeatureStep1.png[width="600"]

In this scenario, there is a file *document.pdf* in the windows _Desktop_ directory, and
the `move` command entered is intended for the file to be moved to the windows _Documents_
directory.

Step 2: After executing the command, the `MoveCommandParser` parses the input into
relevant objects that are required to be executed by the `MoveCommand` object. In
particular, it ensures that there are correctly two arguments passed as described in the
above Syntax. Upon parsing, the parser then creates a new `MoveCommand` that will execute
the user's input.

Step 3: The `MoveCommand` is then executed. Successful execution of the command would return
a *CommandResult* object, while unsuccessful execution due to validation failure will throw
a *CommandException*.
