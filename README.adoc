* This is a desktop Duty Planner application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is meant for army personnel to use to schedule and assign guard duties to personnel.
* Duty can be assigned for the upcoming months and soldiers can see their duties assigned to them as well as perform various different actions.
* This will save a lot of time for commanders planning duties as this will automatically allocate duties and make the process completely automated.
