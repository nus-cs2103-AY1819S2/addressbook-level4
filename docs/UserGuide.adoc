== Introduction

ClubManager is for Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) leaders who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their members
and activities*. More importantly, ClubManager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ClubManager can get
your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get
started. Enjoy!
