== Introduction +

This is the Developer Guide for BrainTrain. This assumes you're already familiar with the User Guide, and are interested in contributing to this project. +

Other skills useful for contributing to BrainTrain are as follows: +

. Good Java knowledge
. Familiarity with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
. Familiarity with Github
. Experience with Command Line Interface based applications

Whether you have any, none or all of the skills above, you will first need to set up a few things before being able to start work on the project.

=== How does BrainTrain work +

This is a brief explanation of how BrainTrain works:

. You can attempt cards in quiz mode, these cards whereby a *question* is displayed to you, and you type in the *answer*.
. You can group multiple cards in a single package called a *lesson*. You can have multiple lessons.
. You can manage lessons in management mode or alternatively do so in your preferred spreadsheet application.

== Setting up +

=== Prerequisites +

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers should use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo
. Clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (for Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your app works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

The *_architecture diagram_* given above illustrates the high-level design of the BrainTrain app. It shows the key components of the app, and how they interact with one another.

==== Brief overview of key components
* `Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`] which is responsible for:

** Initializing the components in the correct sequence and connecting them at app launch.
** Shutting down the components and invoking necessary clean-up methods at app closure.

* <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> is a collection of classes which provides useful utility methods used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

** `LogsCenter` : Used by numerous classes to write log messages to the app's log file.
* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Handles the user interface.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Handles the command executions.
* <<Design-ManagementModel,*`ManagementModel`*>>: Handles the in-memory data of management mode.
* <<Design-QuizModel,*`QuizModel`*>>: Handles the in-memory data of quiz mode.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads and writes data to the hard disk.

The <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>, <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>, <<Design-ManagementModel,*`ManagementModel`*>>, <<Design-QuizModel,*`QuizModel`*>> and <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> components have the following structure:

* Has an API in the form of an Java interface named after the component.
* Has its functionality exposed through a Java class named `{Component Name}Manager`.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to figure 2 below) has it's API defined in the `Logic.java` interface, and exposes its functionality through the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Structure of the `Logic` component

[discrete]
[[componentInteractions]]
==== How do the key components interact
In this section, an example of how the key components interact when the user issues the command `deleteLesson 1` is shown.

.Sequence diagram of the `deleteLesson 1` command
image::sd_delete_lesson.png[width="800"]

Sequence diagrams such as the one above will be provided throughout the developer guide when it is important to highlight how the key components interact. Subsequent sections provide more details on each key component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the `UI` Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` which is made up of the following parts: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`MainPanel`, `LessonListPanel`, `QuizResultPanel`, etc. All these parts, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the `UiPart` abstract class.

The `UI` component uses the *JavaFx* `UI` framework. The layouts for these `UI` parts are defined in corresponding `.fxml` files in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout for  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component,

* passes user input to the `Logic` component for command execution.
* listens for changes to `Logic` and updates if data is changed.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component +

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the `Logic` component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses either `ManagementModeParser` or `QuizModeParser` class to parse the user command.
..  If `ManagementModeParser` is used to parse the user command:
...  This results in a `ManagementCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
...  The command execution can affect the `ManagementModel` (e.g. adding a lesson).
..  If `QuizModeParser` is used to parse the user command:
...  This results in a `QuizCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
...  The command execution can affect the `QuizModel` (e.g. answering a question).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is
returned to the `UI`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object might also instruct the `UI` to perform certain actions,
 such as displaying the user guide to the user.

[[logicInteractions]]
==== How do the logic sub-components interact
In this section, an example of how the `Logic` sub-components interact when the user issues the command `addCard t/Korea t/Seoul h/S` is shown.

.'Sample-Capitals' lesson opened in card view
image::ui_add_card.png[width="512"]

Given the above example, the following sequence of interactions will occur within the `Logic` component.

.Sequence diagram of the `addCard t/Korea t/Seoul h/S` command
image::sd_add_card.png[width="800"]

[[Design-ManagementModel]]
=== ManagementModel component +

.Structure of the ManagementModel component
image::ManagementModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/modelmanager/ManagementModel.java[`ManagementModel.java`]

The `ManagementModel`,

* stores a `LessonList` object which represents a list of `Lesson` objects.
* stores a `UserPref` object which represents the user's preferences.
* stores the in-memory user SRS data in `User`.
* does not depend on any other components.

[[Design-QuizModel]]
=== QuizModel component +

.Structure of the QuizModel Component
image::QuizModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/modelmanager/QuizModel.java[`QuizModel.java`]

The `QuizModel`,

* stores a `Quiz` object that represents a list of `QuizCard`.
* stores a `Session` object that represents a list of `SrsCard`.
* stores a `ManagementModelManager` object that represents the `ManagementModel` component.
* depends on only the `ManagementModel` component.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component +

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* saves lesson data in `.csv` format and read it back.
* saves user preferences in `.json` format and read it back.
* saves the user's SRS data in `.csv` format and read it back.

== Implementation +

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::datastorage[]
=== User storage feature +
The user storage features implements the following functions:

* Parsing user data into the correct format for file saving
* Parsing file into the correct format for user data

NOTE: These functions are automatically performed on opening/closing the application. File I/O is handled in the `CSVUtil` class.

==== User format +
.Data flow diagram for user import and export
image::CsvUserStorage.png[width="800"]

The user is parsed by `CsvUserStorage`, which is converted between User and List<String[]> format. List<String[]> format is the primary format handled by `CsvUtil` for reading and writing to `.csv` files.

A few noteworthy mentions of the main components saved into a `.csv` file for UserStorage are listed below.

==== Hashcode +
This is the question hashcode. Every question will have a unique hashcode for identification.

==== SRSDueDate +
This is the srsDueDate generated for that question. Questions with a nearer due-date will be generated first in the quiz.

==== Difficult +
These are questions that are labelled difficult by the user. Users are able to specifically practise questions that they have labelled difficult in session.

==== Sequence diagram for user storage
Below is a sequence diagram of how a file is parsed into BrainTrain

.Sequence diagram of how a file is imported when BrainTrain application starts
image::CsvUserStorageSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Code snippet +
The following code snippet shows how the user data is obtained:
[source,java]
----
private Optional<CardSrsData> parseStringIntoCard(String[] cardArray) throws
            NumberFormatException, DateTimeParseException {

        for (int i = 0; i < cardArray.length - 1; i++) {
            if (cardArray[i].isEmpty()) {
                logger.warning("There are empty values in the file");
                return Optional.empty();
            }
        }

        try {
            hashCode = Integer.parseInt(cardArray[0]);
            numOfAttempts = Integer.parseInt(cardArray[1]);
            streak = Integer.parseInt(cardArray[2]);
            srs = Instant.parse(cardArray[3]);
            isDifficult = cardArray[4].equals("true");

            if (hashCode == ZERO) {
                logger.warning("Hashcode cannot be 0 in " + filePath.toString());
                return Optional.empty();
            }

        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            logger.warning("Values are not correct in " + filePath.toString());
            return Optional.empty();

        }

        card = new CardSrsData(hashCode, numOfAttempts, streak, srs, isDifficult);

        return Optional.of(card);
    }

----

==== Design considerations +
* ** Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Automate importing/exporting when session is open/close
** Pros: Lesser commands to manage.
** Cons: Opening and closing may take up a lot of time if file is very big.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual commands for user to toggle with to import and export files when desired
** Pros: More control given to user
** Cons: Accidental overwriting of files may occur. Furthermore, if users are not able to parse in values correctly, the file will not be saved. This is troublesome for users who are not tech-savvy.

// end::datastorage[]

// tag::csvstorage[]
[[lessonStorageFeature]]
=== Lesson storage feature
==== Current implementation +
The lesson CSV storage feature implements the following functions:

* Parsing lesson data into a list of string arrays, which is a format OpenCSV accepts for saving to CSV.
* Parsing a list of string arrays back into lesson data, as retrieved from OpenCSV.

Actual file I/O is handled in the CsvUtil class, which uses the OpenCSV library to read/write `.csv` files.

{empty} +

==== Csv lesson format +
.High-level sequence diagram for the `reload` command, an example of lesson loading
image::CsvLessonStorageSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Lessons are parsed by CsvLessonListStorage, being converted between Lesson and List<String[]> formats. The List<String[]> format is the primary format handled by CsvUtil for reading and writing to `.csv` files.

For lessons, there are three main sections when saved to a `.csv` file.

===== Name +
A lesson's name in BrainTrain is equivalent to its file name. +
A lesson named "French" would be saved as "French.csv", and vice-versa.

===== Header +
The header is represented in the file as the first two lines. Each line represents a specific set of data, as outlined below.

The first line represents the type of the corresponding column. Each column can have three types:

. *Tested* +
This marks the column as a core value. By default, the first two instances of *Tested* in the file will be tested in quiz mode. All remaining Tested values are treated as *Not Tested*.
. *Not Tested* +
This marks the column as a core value. However, unlike *Tested*, they will not be tested in quiz mode. You can use the `set` command to change this.
. *Hint* +
This marks the column as a hint value. *Hint* values will appear when the user enters the `\hint` command in quiz mode. Values here are optional and can be left empty.

NOTE: Core values require every value in that column to be non-empty. This guarantees that the user will be tested on something, should they change which fields are tested.

This is a code snippet from the parsing of the header data.

[source,java]
----
for (int i = 0; i < headerArray.length; i++) {
    if (headerArray[i].isEmpty()) {
        headerArray[i] = " ";
    }
}
int coreCount = 0;
int index = 0;
while (index < headerArray.length) {
    String headerChar = headerArray[index].toLowerCase().substring(0, 1);
    if (headerChar.equals(HEADER_CORE_QA)) {
        if (questionIndex == -1) {
            questionIndex = index;
        } else if (answerIndex == -1) {
            answerIndex = index;
        }
        coreCount++;
    } else if (headerChar.equals(HEADER_CORE_NOT_QA)) {
        coreCount++;
    } else if (!headerChar.equals(HEADER_OPTIONAL)) {
        return returnValues;
    }
    index++;
}
----

As seen at the beginning of the while loop, header values are actually treated as single case-insensitive characters. This means an experienced user may simply enter those letters as a shortcut. +

The second line represents the name of each column as shown to the user. Any names left blank are automatically replaced with Unnamed. +
Any discrepancies in the number of types and the number of names will result in the lesson not being loaded. +

===== Card data +
All remaining data is treated as card data. Any invalid data found in memory or from the file is skipped over. +

===== Summary +

.Activity diagram for the `reload` command, highlighting failure conditions
image::ReloadActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

As shown in the above diagram, data that is read in from a file goes through various checks before it is loaded into the application. Any invalid data is skipped over, with an entry in the logs explaining the cause of failure.

{empty} +

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: choice of file type +
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save as `.csv`
** Pros: User is able to modify lesson data in a more advanced external spreadsheet tool like Excel
** Cons: Lack of data verification within the file, JSON is already implemented in original code
* **Alternative 2:** Save as JSON
** Pros: All values can be verified through the file
** Cons: Difficult for user to edit manually

Alternative 1 was chosen as ease of use is a high priority for the project. Most computer users are familiar with the Microsoft Office suite of applications, such as Word and Excel. As Excel allows `.csv` files to be shown in a spreadsheet, it was intended that users use Excel alongside BrainTrain for easy lesson management.

===== Aspect: handling of invalid data +
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Skip over specific lesson/card
** Pros: User data is not automatically overwritten
** Cons: User has to manually fix any issues with their data
* **Alternative 2:** Automatically fix data
** Pros: Ease of use for user
** Cons: Automatic fix may not be as desired by user

Alternative 1 was chosen as creators are expected to have some skill in data editing. Normal users would ideally only download lessons from a creator, and would not be familiar enough with the lesson data to fix any issues.

[[mgtOverview]]
=== Management feature +
Management feature provides users with the ability to add, edit and delete lessons in *Lesson View* and *Card View* modes.

==== Lesson View +
In *Lesson View*, users can:

* `addLesson` - Adds a lesson to the list of lessons loaded in-memory.
* `deleteLesson` - Deletes a lesson from the list of lessons loaded in-memory.
* `edit` - Opens a lesson in *Card View* for editing
* `listLessons` - Lists all cards with full details

{empty} +

==== Card View +
In *Card View*, users can:

* `addCard` - Adds a card to the lesson opened in *Card View*.
* `deleteCard` - Deletes a card from the lesson opened in *Card View*.
* `set` - Sets the 2 test values to be tested in quiz mode for all cards in the lesson
* `listCards` - Lists all cards with full details
* `quit` - Quits *Card View* and returns to *Lesson View*

In the subsequent sub-sections, I will discuss the 3 major model classes used to manage lessons and flashcards, `Card.java`, `Lesson.java`, and `LessonList.java`. These classes are also used by the <<lessonStorageFeature, Lesson Storage Feature>> and <<sessionFeature, Session Feature>>.

{empty} +

[[cardClass]]
==== Card class +
An instance of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/card/Card.java[`Card.java`] represents a flashcard which contains 2 or more test values and 0 or more hint values. It takes in a list of test values, and optionally a list of hint values.

The following code shows how the card is generated:

[NOTE]
====
Test and hint values are referred to as core and optional values internally. These terms are interchangeable.
====

[source,java]
----
/**
  * Creates a {@code Card} which represents a flash card.
  *
  * @param cores {@link #cores} a {@code Card} must have.
  * @param optionals {@link #optionals} a {@code Card} can have.
  */
 public Card(List<String> cores, List<String> optionals) {
     requireAllNonNull(cores, optionals);
     this.cores = new ArrayList<>();
     this.cores.addAll(cores);
     this.optionals = new ArrayList<>();
     this.optionals.addAll(optionals);
     hashCode = generateHashCode();
 }

 /**
  * Creates a {@code Card} which represents a flash card.
  *
  * @param cores {@link #cores} a {@code Card} must have.
  */
 public Card(List<String> cores) {
     // Generates a Card without optionals.
 }
----

These 2 constructors are called by the `Lesson.java` which generates a list of cards.

{empty} +

==== Lesson class +
An instance of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/lesson/Lesson.java[`Lesson.java`] represents a lesson which contains multiple flashcards of the same type and topic. This lesson can be loaded into quiz mode for testing.

The following code shows how cards are generated by the lesson:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Adds a {@link Card} object to the lesson.
 * {@code fields} are separated into two separate sub-lists of cores and optionals based on
 * {@link #coreHeaders}'s {@code size()}.
 *
 * @param fields the {@link Card}'s cores and optionals in this order
 */
public void addCard(List<String> fields) {
    requireAllNonNull(fields);
    if (fields.size() == coreHeaders.size()) {
        addCard(new Card(fields));
    } else {
        List<String> cores = fields.subList(0, coreHeaders.size());
        int optionalStart = coreHeaders.size();
        int optionalEnd = fields.size();
        List<String> optionals = fields.subList(optionalStart, optionalEnd);
        addCard(new Card(cores, optionals));
    }
}

/**
 * Adds {@link Card} objects to the lesson.
 *
 * @param cards a list of {@link Card} objects to be added to the lesson
 */
public void addCards(List<Card> cards) {
    for (Card card: cards) {
        addCard(card);
    }
}
----

The `addCards(List<Card> cards)` method is called by the `LessonList.java` which generates a list of lessons.

{empty} +

==== LessonList class +
An instance of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/lesson/LessonList.java[`LessonList.java`] represents a list of lessons. It has helper functions to assist with the management of lessons.

The following code shows how the `Main`, `Storage`, `Logic`, and `ManagementModel` key components use the `LessonList.java` class.

===== Usage by the `Main` and `Storage` key components +
When the `Main` component loads upon app launch, it triggers the `Storage` component which loads lessons from the hard disk into memory by calling the `LessonList()` constructor, the `addLesson(Lesson lesson)` and other methods.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Creates a new {@link LessonList} which is used to store a list of {@link Lesson} objects.
 */
public LessonList() {
    lessons = new ArrayList<>();
}

/**
 * Adds a {@link Lesson} object to {@link #lessons}.
 *
 * @param lesson {@link Lesson} to be added to {@link #lessons}
 */
public void addLesson(Lesson lesson) {
    requireNonNull(lesson);
    lessons.add(lesson);
}
----

===== Usage by the `Logic` and `ManagementModel` key components +
When the `Logic` component parses an `addCard` command, it triggers the `ManagementModel` component to use the `addCardToOpenedLesson(Card card)` to add a card to the lesson opened for editing in *Card View*.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Adds a {@link Card} to the {@link #openedLesson}.
 *
 * @param card {@link Card} to be added to the {@link #openedLesson}
 */
public void addCardToOpenedLesson(Card card) {
    requireAllNonNull(openedLesson, card);
    openedLesson.addCard(card);
}
----

{empty} +

[[addCard]]
==== Add card command: `addCard` +
The `addCard` command adds a card to the lesson which is being edited in *Card View*. +

For example:

* Given a lesson on country capitals which has 2 test values, 'Country' and 'Capital', and 1 hint value, 'Hint'.
* If a user wants to add a flashcard to this lesson, he would enter `addCard t/Korea t/Seoul h/S`.

How it will look like to the user after entering the command:

.Expected result after the card is added
image::ui_add_card_after.png[width="512"]

Given the above example, the following sequence of interactions will occur within the `Logic` component.

image::sd_add_card.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

[[mgtConsiderations]]
==== Design consideration +

===== Aspect: contextual management commands +
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only lesson-related commands are allowed in *Lesson View* sub-management mode, and only card-related commands are allowed in *Card View* sub-management mode.
** Pros: The user need not specify which lesson he is adding or deleting cards from. It is clear which lesson is currently being edited.
** Con: Tedious to implement given that it requries significant refactoring of the base code provided.

* **Alternative 2:** A single management mode where all lesson and card-related commands can be executed.
** Pro: This is significantly easier to implement give that no major refactoring is requred.
** Con: This compromises the user experience.

**Alternative 1** was chosen because it will vastly improve the user experience. For example, if a user were to need to add multiple cards to a specific lesson, alternative 2 would require the user to enter the lesson's index or name for each `addCard` command (e.g. `addCard n/Sample-Capitals t/Korea t/Seoul` where 'Sample-Capitals' is the lesson's name). +

On the other hand, alternative 1 only requires the user to open the lesson for editing in *Card View* once, before calling the `addCard` commands. These `addCard` commands will not require the user to specify which lesson to add the cards to. +

Hence by choosing alternative 1, the user experience was vastly improved given that the user interface is easier to use.

// end::evan-mgt[]

// tag::session[]
[[sessionFeature]]
=== Session feature +
Session feature generates cards for users in quiz session based on their requirement.

==== Current implementation +
Session feature implements the following functions and commands:

* Combining data from lesson and user storage together.
* SrsCardManager:
** Generating a list of cards for quiz based on different modes and SRS (Space-Repetition technique) method.
** Updating user data after quiz ends.
* `start` - An input with lesson index, count of cards and mode parameters.

==== SRS method +
The SRS method allows users to be tested with the most urgent questions. The method gives each card a `srsDueDate` field which contains
an instant value representing the deadline of testing this card again.

* The SRS method updates users profile using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system[Leitner_system].
** There are several levels in the Leitner_system. The lower the level is, the more urgent the card is. When the user answers correctly, the level of that card will increase by one. Otherwise it will decrease by one.
** User data will be updated based on their performance in quiz session. Generally speaking, if the user answer correctly, the `srsDueDate` of the current card will be carry-forwarded.

.Explanation diagram for Leitner-System
image::Leitner-system.png[width="300"]

==== SrsCardManager +
The `SrsCardManager` generates needed list of `QuizCard` when the user wants to start a quiz. This class includes four methods for four different modes correspondingly as shown below.

* Difficult mode: `previewDifficult()`
* Preview mode: `preview()`
* Learn mode: `learn()`
* Review mode: `sort()`

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes a new `StartCommand`.

.Activity diagram for session generation
image::SrsCardManagerGenerateActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

[NOTE]
====
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Space-Repetition technique] is only applied in review mode.
====

The `SrsCardManager` also updates user data using `UpdateCardData()` after receiving results from `Quiz`.

====  Management start command: `start` +

The `start` command starts a quiz session based on input parameters. It will analyze the current storage information and then generate the list of `QuizCard` using `SrsCardManager`. It will test the 2 values set to be tested for the lesson. The generating rules are different for different `QuizMode` as explained in a subsequent section. Once the `start` command have succeeded running, the system will switch to the quiz mode.

The `start` command needs users to specify `LessonIndex`, `CardCount` and `QuizMode` parameter.

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between the various classes when the user starts a sample quiz:

.Sequence diagram for start feature
image::QuizStartCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design consideration

===== Aspect: SRS method for updating +

* **Alternative 1: Leinter System (current choice)**
** Pros: Efficient in calculation and easy to understand.
** Cons: The time interval between levels cannot be long.
* **Alternative 2: Pimsleur's graduated-interval recall**
** Pros: Short time interval between the first few repetitions.
** Cons: No level attribute to group the element clearly.
* Alternative 1 was chosen because it clearly displays the due date in several levels. Developers can also understand it easily since the actions for updating is simple. Besides, the system does not require the testing interval of the same card to be very small.

===== Aspect: data storage to support the SRS system +

* **Alternative 1: The system saves the due time into several levels and stores in a hashmap with card's hashcode (current choice)**
** Pros: It is easier to update the user progress using Leinter System since the levels are already stored.
** Cons: The system needs to generate the range of due time for each level by default and the range may be unreasonable.
* **Alternative 2: The system saves the due time and hashcode of cards directly in a 2D array**
** Pros: It is clearer to see the match between card and its due time with same hashcode.
** Cons: It is more difficult to set the updated due time for each single card.
* Alternative 1 was chosen because the quiz only passes back information of total attempts and total number of correct answers. It is hard to generate an algorithm to update due time for each single card with only these quiz information. Thus, grouping cards as different levels and updating due time under different levels can solve this problem more efficiently.

===== Aspect: review mode +

* **Alternative 1: Starts test directly (current choice)**
** Pros: Users can focus on the tests directly.
** Cons: No time for them to have a quick reminder.
* **Alternative 2: Starts with previewing questions and answers**
** Pros: Users can recall the cards before testing.
** Cons: The difficulty level becomes lower.
* Alternative 1 was chosen because users are supposed to enter the test directly when they are reviewing cards. They can then judge their memorizing results in a most accurate level.

=== Quiz feature +
Quiz feature allows users to enter quiz related commands and answer.

==== Current implementation +
The quiz feature processes the following inputs:

* `[ANSWER]...` - An input without a prefix `\` is treated as an answer.
* `\difficult` - Labels current question as difficult or not.
* `\help` - Lists all quiz commands and inputs which will be accepted.
* `\hint` - Reveals additional information to help the user to answer the question.
* `\quit` - Quits quiz mode and saves attempt progress.
* `\status` - Lists current quiz progress.

==== Quiz class +

link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/quiz/Quiz.java[`Quiz.java`] holds all the in-memory
quiz data. It takes in a list of <<card,cards>> from `Session`. Then, it generates an expanded list of cards based on the `mode` indicated by the user. The generated list of cards in both
`review` and `learn` mode includes cards which questions and answers are flipped. This to ensure that users are
memorizing both question and answer values. According to the mode which the user has chosen, the cards will be
displayed differently as seen below.

In the four different modes:

* **Preview**: both the question and answer are shown to the user.

.Question displayed in `preview` mode.
image::quiz-command-examples/quiz-preview.PNG[width="300"]

* **Review**: only the question is shown as the user needs to answer the question.

.Question displayed in `review` mode.
image::quiz-command-examples/quiz-review.PNG[width="300"]

* **Learn**: is a combination of preview and review, the user sees both the question and
answer as in `preview` mode, before attempting the question with the answer hidden as in `review` mode.

.Question displayed in `learn` mode.
image::quiz-command-examples/quiz-learn.PNG[width="670"]

* **Difficult**: similar to preview mode but only contains questions which have been labelled as
difficult.

// end::quiz[]
The following code shows how the cards are generated:
[source,java]
----
private List<QuizCard> generate() {
    generatedQuizCardList = new ArrayList<>();

    switch (mode) {
    case PREVIEW:
        generatePreview();
        break;
    case LEARN:
        // Learn is a combination of preview + review
        generatePreview();
        generateReview();
        break;
    case REVIEW:
        generateReview();
        break;
    case DIFFICULT:
        generatePreview();
        break;
    default:
        break;
    }

    generatedCardSize = generatedQuizCardList.size();
    return generatedQuizCardList;
}

private void generateReview() {
    QuizCard currentCard;
    for (int i = 0; i < originalQuizCardList.size(); i++) {
        currentCard = originalQuizCardList.get(i);
        generatedQuizCardList.add(
            currentCard.generateOrderedQuizCardWithIndex(i, QuizMode.REVIEW));
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < originalQuizCardList.size(); i++) {
        currentCard = originalQuizCardList.get(i);
        generatedQuizCardList.add(
            currentCard.generateFlippedQuizCardWithIndex(i));
    }
}

private void generatePreview() {
    QuizCard currentCard;

    for (int i = 0; i < originalQuizCardList.size(); i++) {
        currentCard = originalQuizCardList.get(i);
        generatedQuizCardList.add(
            currentCard.generateOrderedQuizCardWithIndex(i, QuizMode.PREVIEW));
    }
}

// tag::quiz[]
====  Quiz answer command: `[ANSWER]` +
.High-level sequence diagram for the `ANSWER` command, an example of completing a quiz.
image::AnwerComponetSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `[ANSWER]` feature is facilitated by `QuizAnswerCommand`. The command takes in user input
as answer, which will be processed later when the command is executed.

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between the various classes when the user
answered the question correctly:

.Sequence diagram for answer feature
image::QuizAnswerCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

In the `execute` method of the `QuizAnswerCommand`, the following steps can be performed:

1. Quiz result +
This step checks if the user is shown the result, this is performed because the quiz can only end after
the result has been shown. Once the quiz ends, BrainTrain will save the progress of the quiz
to the file specified by the user.

2. Handling of answer +
This step checks if the answer should be handled, if user is in `PREVIEW` mode it will not be
handled. Otherwise, the total attempts and streak of the question will be updated depending on whether the question has been answered correctly.

3. Handling of next question +
This step verifies that the question has been answered correctly, and checks if there are still questions
left for the current quiz. Depending on the check, it will then displays the next question or the quiz result.

The following code shows how the steps could be performed:

[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
    requireNonNull(model);
    this.quizModel = requireQuizModel(model);
    this.card = quizModel.getCurrentQuizCard();
    this.isCurrentCardWrong = false;

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    if (quizModel.isResultDisplay()) {
        endQuiz();
        return new CommandResult("", true, false, false);
    }

    if (card.isWrongTwice() || card.getQuizMode() != QuizMode.PREVIEW) {
        sb.append(handleCurrentCardAnswer());
    }

    if (!isCurrentCardWrong) {
        String result = handleIfCardLeft();
        sb.append(result);
    }

    return new CommandResult(sb.toString(), true, false, false);
}

----

// end::quiz[]

====  Quiz quit command: `\quit` +
The `\quit` will force quit the current quiz and save the attempted questions to the location which
the user has specified in `UserPref`. By default it will be saved to `\userdata\savedata.csv`. Once
the `\quit` command is completed, the user will be returned to the management mode.

.Sequence diagram for quit feature
image::QuizQuitCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

====  Quiz status command: `\status` +
The `\status` feature lists the total number of attempts you have made, total number of
question you have gotten correct, and which question you are currently on.

.Sequence diagram for status feature
image::QuizStatusCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// tag::quiz[]
==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: quiz and management commands execution +
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Run quiz in a different mode
** Pro: Least restricted choice of answer and great user experience.
** Con: Tedious to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Run quiz together with the rest of the commands
** Pro: Easy to implement.
** Con: Restricted answer and compromised user experience. Answer cannot start with words already
reserved for management commands.
(e.g. `start`)

**Alternative 1** is chosen because it allows the user to have a more flexible choice of
word. For certain questions, it is possible for the answer to be "start". Hence by choosing alternative 1, the choice of answer will not be restricted. Also, by running the quiz in a different mode, it allows the user to have intuitive
interaction in quiz mode.
// end::quiz[]

=== Logging +

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the app
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration +

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation +

We used AsciiDoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose AsciiDoc over Markdown because AsciiDoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation +

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation +

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format +

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide documentation settings +

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://AsciiDoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[AsciiDoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file documentation settings +

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site template +

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running tests +

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests +

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire app by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing +
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev ops

=== Build automation +

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration +

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting +

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews +
When a pull request has changes to AsciiDoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those AsciiDoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release +

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies +

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product scope +

*Target user profile*:

[appendix]
== Glossary +

[[card]] Card::
A card contains 2 or more `TEST` values and 0 or more `HINT` values. When a card is tested in
quiz mode, 2 of its `TEST` values will be tested as a question-answer pair. `HINT` values will be
shown when the `\hint` command is entered.

[[lesson]] Lesson::
A lesson contains <<card,cards>> of the same type and topic. It has 2 or more `TEST` values and 0
 or more `HINT` values. Cards added to this lesson must have corresponding `TEST` values, but need
 not have matching `HINT` values. By default, the first 2 `TEST` values of cards in this lesson will
 be tested when the lesson is started in quiz mode. You can change this by using the `set` command.

[[mainstream-os]] Mainstream OS::
Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

[[session]] Session::
User’s current learning progress

[[srs]] Spaced Repetition System (SRS)::
The technique of gradually delaying or accelerating the testing of content based on the user’s success.
