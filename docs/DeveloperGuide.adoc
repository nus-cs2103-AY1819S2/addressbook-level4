== Introduction

BookSquirrel is for those who *want to keep a record of books they've read*. More importantly, BookSquirrel is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, BookSquirrel can get your management of books done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFX plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all the resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-4/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `deleteBook 1` command
image::SDforDeleteBook.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

//tag::uidiagram[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

//end::uidiagram[]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BookListPanel`, `ReviewListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ReviewBrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `BookShelfParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a book).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

//tag::logicdiagram[]
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteBook 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteBook 1` Command
image::DeleteBookSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
//end::logicdiagram[]

//tag::modeldiagram[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]
//end::modeldiagram[]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the BookShelf data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Book>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `BookShelf`, which `Book` can reference. This would allow `BookShelf` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Book` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]

// tag::storage[]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* can save the BookShelf data in JSON format and read it back.
* both the data of books and reviews will be saved.
* users are not supposed to touch the data file (the file inside the `data` folder) directly. If the user insists on doing so, the data might be corrupted.
* users are not supposed to add data files into the app manually. If the user accidentally corrupts the data file, he or she may have to reinstall the app and all data will get lost.
* developers can edit the data file for the purpose of testing.

// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::sortBook[]
=== SortBook feature
==== Current Implementation

The sortBook mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBookShelf`.
It extends `BookShelf` with the sort function which will sort the `UniqueBookList`. `UniqueBookList` implemented the BookList as `ObservableList<Book>`. sortBook command sort the booklist in specify order by implementing the `Comparator<Book>`.

Additionally, it uses/implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBookShelf#sort()` -- It calls `UniqueBookList` sortBooks function and notifies the listeners.

* `BookShelf#indicateModified()` -- Notifies listeners that the bookshelf has been modified.

* `UniqueBookList#sortBooks()` -- Implement the comparator, call `ObservableList<Book>` and pass in the comparator.

* `ObservableList<Book>#sort()` -- sort the internalList is specify order.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sortBook mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial bookshelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookshelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `sortBook st/rating` command to sort all the books in the bookshelf in ascending order. The command will be pass to SortBookCommand Parser to convert it to SortBook command, the parser will check the correctness of the command. If the command is in an incorrect format, the parser will show correct command instruction to the user, otherwise, the parser will call the constructor of SortBook command.

Step 3. `SortBookCommand#execute` will be call, it will check whether the Bookshelf is empty before proceed to call `ModelManager#sort()`.

[NOTE]
If the Bookshelf is empty, CommandException(MESSAGE_BOOK_LIST_EMPTY) will be thrown.

Step 4. If everything is correct, `VersionedBookShelf#sort()` will be called. It will execute `UniqueBookList#sortBooks` and `BookShelf#indicateModified` will be called after the list is been sorted to notify the listener that display data has been modified.

Step 5. `ObservableList<Book>` was implemented in `UniqueBookList` as internal list. `UniqueBookList#sortBooks` will call `ObservableList<Book>#sort` to sort the internal list by providing custom Comparator.

Step 6. ` model#commitBookShelf()` will be executed to store the current Bookshelf into `List<ReadOnlyBookShelf>` for support undo/redo command after the list is sorted and notify the listener.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Sorting algorithm implemented.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts using library sorting method.
** Pros: Easy to implement, easy to maintain.
** Cons: The sorting method is too general, can have a better sorting algorithm.

* **Alternative 2:** Using custom sorting method.
** Pros: more custom, may improve performance.
** Cons: hard to maintain and easy to produce bugs.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the sort commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts with the complete list.
** Pros: Easy to implement, as the list coming with sort function.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of speed, as we need to sort the whole list.

* **Alternative 2:** Sorts with sub-list that available to the user.
** Pros: It is faster than the first choice as we only need to sort a partial list.
** Cons: The sub-list is not supported sort function, it's hard and time consumed to manipulate sorting and put it back to sub-list.

// end::sortBook[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBookShelf`.
It extends `BookShelf` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `BookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBookShelf#commit()` -- Saves the current bookshelf state in its history.
* `VersionedBookShelf#undo()` -- Restores the previous bookshelf state from its history.
* `VersionedBookShelf#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone bookshelf state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitBookShelf()`, `Model#undoBookShelf()` and `Model#redoBookShelf()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial bookshelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookshelf state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `deleteBook 1` command to delete the first book in the bookshelf. The `deleteBook` command calls `Model#commitBookShelf()`, causing the modified state of the Bookshelf after the `deleteBook 1` command executes to be saved in the `BookShelfStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Bookshelf state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `addBook n/David ...` to add a new book. The `addBook` command also calls `Model#commitBookShelf()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `BookShelfStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitBookShelf()`, so the bookshelf state will not be saved into the `BookShelfStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the book was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoBookShelf()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous bookshelf state, and restores the bookshelf to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial bookshelf state, then there are no previous bookshelf states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canundoBookShelf()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how to undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoBookShelf()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the bookshelf to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `BookShelfStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Bookshelf state, then there are no undone bookshelf states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canredoBookShelf()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `listBook`. Commands that do not modify the Bookshelf, such as `listBook`, will usually not call `Model#commitBookShelf()`, `Model#undoBookShelf()` or `Model#redoBookShelf()`. Thus, the `BookShelfStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitBookShelf()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `BookShelfStateList`, all bookshelf states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `addBook n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Bookshelf.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteBook`, just save the book being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of Bookshelf states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedBookShelf`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::book[]
=== AddBook feature
==== Current Implementation

The addBook mechanism is facilitated by `BookShelf`.
It contains `UniqueBookList` in which all the book data are stored and duplicates are not allowed. Books with same book name are considered as duplicates.
Additionally, it uses the following operations from `BookShelf`:

* `model#hasBook()` -- Check if the book already exists in the Bookshelf.
* `model#addBook()` -- To add the new book into Bookshelf.
* `model#commitBookShelf()` -- Saves the current Bookshelf state for undo/redo..

These operations are exposed to the `Model` interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addBook mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial bookshelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookshelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `addBook n/Alice a/HR m/5 tag/fantasy` command to add the book called Alice, written by HR, with a rating of 5 and tag of fantasy in the Bookshelf. The `AddBookCommandParser` check if the command is in valid format.

[NOTE]
If the command is not in valid format, ParseException(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT) will be thrown. The book will not be added to the bookshelf.

Step 3. The `addBook` command calls `Model#hasBook()`, checking if the book already exists in the bookshelf.

[NOTE]
If the book already exists, CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_BOOK) will be thrown. It will not call `Model#commitBookShelf()`, so the bookshelf state will not be saved into the `BookShelfStateList`.

Step 4. The bookshelf now adds the book to the Bookshelf after making sure there are no duplicates, and calls Model#commitBookShelf(), causing the modified state of the Bookshelf after the `addBook` command executes to be saved in the BookShelfStateList

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `addBook n/Alice a/HR m/5 tag/fantasy`.

image::AddBookHighLevelSequenceDiagram.jpg[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an AddBook command:

image::AddBookActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How duplicate of book is defined

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Books with same book name are considered as duplicates.
** Pros: Easy to support other commands such as addReview which search for the book based on its name.
** Cons: User may encounter trouble if they read two books with the same name but written by different authors.
* **Alternative 2:** Books with multiple identical fields (eg. book name and author, book name and rating, etc) are considered as the same book.
** Pros: Able to store books with same but different in other fields.
** Cons: Causing trouble in executing other commands like addReview as more parameters must be provided to search for a certain book.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the addBook command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire book as one object contains different fields such as author, rating, etc.
** Pros: Easy to implement delete and other features that change an entire book.
** Cons: Maybe more difficult to implement the summary feature which needs to obtain statistics of all separate fields stored in each book, eg. find the most popular author.

[NOTE]
An example of the current model is given below. +
 +
image:BookModelComponentClassOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

* **Alternative 2:** Store a Tag list and an Author List in BookShelf, which Book can reference.
** Pros: Easier to obtain statistics regarding each component.
** Cons: It is harder to manage book object as we need to find a way to connect all components together.

[NOTE]
An example of the alternative model is given below. +
 +
image:BookModelComponentAlternativeClassOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

=== EditBook feature
==== Current Implementation

The editBook mechanism is facilitated by `BookShelf`.
It contains `UniqueBookList` in which all the book data are stored and duplicates are not allowed. Books with same book name are considered as duplicates.
Additionally, it uses the following operations from `BookShelf`:

* `model#hasBook()` -- Check if the book already exists in the Bookshelf.
* `model#setBook()` -- To set a book with field values provided.
* `model#commitBookShelf()` -- Saves the current Bookshelf state for undo/redo..

These operations are exposed to the `Model` interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addBook mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial bookshelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookshelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `editBook 1 n/Alice a/HR m/5 tag/fantasy` command to edit the first book present in the Bookshelf to be a book called Alice, written by HR, with a rating of 5 and tag of fantasy in the Bookshelf. The `addBook` command calls `Model#hasBook()`, checking if the book already exists in the bookshelf.

[NOTE]
If the new book name already exists, CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_BOOK) will be thrown. It will not call `Model#commitBookShelf()`, so the bookshelf state will not be saved into the `BookShelfStateList`.

Step 4. The bookshelf now set the fields of the first book to the new ones provided, and calls Model#commitBookShelf(), causing the modified state of the Bookshelf after the `addBook` command executes to be saved in the BookShelfStateList

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How editBook is executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the index to figure out the book user wishes to edit.
** Pros: Easy to select the book user wish to edit with the support of our UI.
** Cons: A listBook command might be needed before executing editBook if the current filtered Bookshelf is empty
* **Alternative 2:** Use exact book name to figure out the book user wishes to edit.
** Pros: No need to first filter out a non-empty Bookshelf.
** Cons: Causing trouble for the user to type in the full name of the book.
// end::book[]

// tag::listBook[]
=== ListBook feature

==== Current Implementation

The current version of listBook command works to help the user to search books that satisfy certain criteria. The user can look for books by giving keywords of book name, author, tag or rating.

This would be handy when there are many books on the bookshelf. It also makes the app more user-friendly as the user sometimes cannot remember the exact full name of a book but only know a few things about the book desired.

Compared to the `list` command in the address book app, our `listBookCommand` is an implementation of the combination of `list` and `find` and even more functionally helpful, as it accepts more filtering criteria than the original command does.

Given below is an example usage and how listBook feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial bookshelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookshelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `listBook n/Life`.

Step 3. The `ListBookCommandParser` parses this command. It will first create some predicates according to the input and then use theses predicates to create a `ListBookCommand`. The exception will be thrown if the command is invalid. The command is created by the logic manager as follows.

image::listBookCommandLogic.png[width="800"]

Step 4. The `ListBookCommand` will be executed. The command checks all the books on the `BookShelf`, selects out books whose name contain `Life` based on `BookNameContainsKeywordPredicate`.

The sequence diagram of the whole process is as follows.

image::listBookSqDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to select books.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only books match all criteria provided will be selected. For example, if the user gives 2 book name keywords and 2 ratings, only books matching at least 1 name keyword and at least 1 rating will be selected. Books match 1 name keyword but no ratings will not be considered.
** Pros: Easy to test and manage.
** Cons: Such search techniques may fail to provide the user with enough information.
* **Alternative 2:** Books that match at least one criteria will be selected. For example, if the user gives 2 book name keywords and 2 ratings, books that match 1 name keyword but no ratings will still be selected.
** Pros: More likely to provide the user with the book that the user is looking for.
** Cons: Such a design also fails to narrow down search results when the user is providing more keywords for the targeted book. Besides, it's hard to test and manage.

// end::listBook[]

// tag::summary[]
=== Summary feature

==== Current Implementation

The summary feature is a command works to summarize the books on the bookshelf. The user can have an overview of what he/she has read.

Given below is an example of usage and how the summary feature works.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial bookshelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookshelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `summary`

Step 3. The `SummaryCommandParser` parses this command.

Step 4. The `SummaryCommandParser`returns an `SummaryCommand`. The exception will be thrown if the command is invalid.

Step 5. The `SummaryCommand` executes. The command will traverse all books in the bookshelf, checks, if there are authors or tags, appear more than once and give relative details. The command will also return the highest rating of books on the bookshelf.

The summary command creates a summary as follows:

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Component to fetch the data

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Model manager is in charge of data processing, then returns the result to the command.
** Pros: This prevents the command from accessing data managed by the model manager, thus independence of different parts is guaranteed.
** Cons: More methods are introduced into the model manager. To include more information in the summary, not only the summary command should be modified, but also more information query methodS should be added in The `Model`. This somehow break the abstraction.
* **Alternative 2:** Model manager passes the whole bookshelf to the command, then command process the data according to this list.
** Pros: More flexible as the command can extract any information it desires. Whenever we want the summary to include more information, we just directly fetch the data from the copy of the bookshelf.
** Cons: This approach is unsafe and may lead to more bugs as it violates the principle of independence.
* **Alternative 3:** Model manager creates a list of the copies of the books in the bookshelf and passes it to the command.
** Pros: More flexible as the command can read whatever information desired, thus keeps the bookshelf safe from any unintended modification.
** Cons: The manager no longer has control over what information is accessible to the command, thus may still expose some sensitive information. Besides, making a copy of the whole list is not practical when there are many books in the bookshelf.

=== AddReview feature

==== Current Implementation

Given below is an example usage and how addReview feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial bookshelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookshelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `addReview n/Alice in Wonderland rt/Carroll has depicted a unique world I hadn't seen before r/Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll is a story about Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands into a fantasy world that is full of weird, wonderful people and animals.`

Step 3. The `AddReviewCommandParser` parses this command and creates a `Review` object based on the parameters in user input.

Step 4. The `AddReviewCommandParser`returns an `AddReviewCommand`. The exception will be thrown if the command is invalid.

Step 5. The `AddReviewCommand` executes. The command checks if the book to which the review is added exists in the `BookShelf`, based on `BookNameContainsExactKeywordPredicate`. If the book does not exist, an exception is thrown.

Step 6. If the book exists, the review is added to the review list of the Bookshelf.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `addBook n/Alice rt/rt/interesting r/an interesting story book...`

image::AddReviewSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to store Reviews

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a List to store Reviews
** Pros: There will be an order for the reviews added based on time created. More clear to users.
** Cons: May have unforeseen bugs or implications.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a Set to store all Reviews, just like tags.
** Pros: Easy to code and manage because it is the same implementation as tags.
** Cons: Set does not allow duplicate reviews. Need to check for duplicate reviews added.

===== Aspect: Where to store Reviews

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have another independent list for reviews in the bookshelf.
** Pros: Much easier to implement.
** Cons: Reviews and Books now have exactly the same structure, which violates the DRY principle.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a Set within a Book, just like tags.
** Pros: The model makes more sense because Reviews belong to Books.
** Cons: Makes it more difficult to link with the UI component.

===== Aspect: Constraints on Review Parameters

* ReviewTitle has the same constraints as BookName, less than 50 characters.
* ReviewMessage should be less than or equal to 400 characters. This is because of the
BookBrowserPanel used to display the ReviewMessage currently cannot hold more than 400 characters.
The longer text also makes it more difficult to edit in the small CommandBox. Future releases would consider
adding enhanced review input panel to make the review feature more user-friendly.

===== Aspect: Auto-creation of Date for the Review

* Currently, the constructor of Review automatically assigns a dateCreated to it.
This feature is provided for the convenience of the user. An overloaded constructor
is available where the date can be passed in as a parameter, to be used in testing.

=== ListReview feature

==== Current Implementation

Given below are an example of usage and program behavior:

Step 1. The user executes `listReview 1`

Step 2. The ListReviewCommandParser parses this command and returns a new ListReviewCommand with the specified index.

Step 3. The ListReviewCommand executes. The book with the specified index is selected.

Step 4. Reviews of the selected book will be displayed in the rightmost panel.

Alternatively, the user can click the book to select it.

===== Aspect:

=== ListAllReviews feature
==== Current Implementation

The ListAllReviews Feature uses the same implementation as the ListBook feature:

Step 1. The user executes `listAllReviews`

Step 2. A new ListAllReviewsCommand is returned by the BookShelfParser

Step 3. The ListAllReviewsCommand executes. Review list panel is updated to show all reviews.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Whether to combine ListAllReviews command with ListReview command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** not to combine.
** Pros: Command is more logical and user-friendly because it is actually not intuitive to have two functions combined in one ListReview command.
** Cons: Inconsistency with the ListBook command may cause confusion.
* **Alternative 2:** Combine.
** Pros: Consistency.
** Cons: Command is not intuitive, and takes extra time to implement review predicates.

=== SelectReview feature
==== Current Implementation

Selection of review is implemented the same way as the selection of a book.

In addition, review message of a selected review will be displayed in the book browser panel.

Step 1. The user executes `selectReview 1`

Step 2. The SelectReviewCommandParser parses this command and returns a new SelectReviewCommand with index 1.

Step 3. The SelectReviewCommand executes. The review with the specified index is selected.

Step 4. The BookBrowserPanel listens to the change in the selected review and displays its review message.


=== DeleteReview feature
==== Current Implementation

The review is deleted based on the index.

Step 1. The user executes `deleteReview 1`

Step 2. The DeleteReviewCommandParser parses this command and returns a new DeleteReviewCommand with index 1.

Step 3. The DeleteReviewCommand executes. The review with the specified index is deleted.

==== Other Design Considerations

===== Whether to Implement EditReview

It seems natural to implement EditReview as one component of the CRUD features. However,
editing an existing review requires re-typing everything and seems painstaking to the user. It makes much more sense to just delete
the original review and add a new one. Hence. EditReview is currently not implemented.




// end::addReview[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting the document to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide documentation settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`]  file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value* if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc`  files may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in the link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.util.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as how they are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changed asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Bookshelf depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

. Adding a book to an empty bookshelf.

.. Prerequisites: Clear the bookshelf using `clear` command. The bookshelf shall be empty after the command execution.
.. Test case: `addBook n/Alice in Wonderland n/multiple name a/Lewis Carroll m/5 t/fantasy t/fairy tale` +
   Expected: No book is added. Error details are shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Test case: `addBook n/Alice in Wonderland n/multiple name a/Lewis Carroll m/5 t/fantasy t/fairy tale` +
   Expected: Adds a book named Alice in Wonderland to the record. The book is written by Lewis Carroll, rated 5 stars, and labeled with tags ‘fantasy’ and ‘fairy tale’.

=== Editing a book

. Editing an existing book in the bookshelf.

.. Prerequisites: At least one book exists in the bookshelf, and no book in the bookshelf is named `test`.
.. Test case: `editBook 1 n/test a/some author t/some tag` +
   Expected: Change the name, author, tag of the first book to test, some author, some tag.
.. Test case: `editBook 1 t/` +
   Expected: Clear all the existing tags of the first book in the result list.

=== Deleting a book

. Deleting a book while all books are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all book using the `listBook` command. All books present in the bookshelf are shown in the list.
.. Test case: `deleteBook 1` +
   Expected: First book is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted book shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `deleteBook 0` +
   Expected: No book is deleted. Error details are shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `deleteBook` +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Listing books in the bookshelf

. Search and display the books in the bookshelf
.. Prerequisites: The following test cases work as described only when you haven't deleted or modified _Madame Bovary_ and _Pride and Prejudice_ in the bookshelf. If you have, please only use the following test cases as examples and generate your own test cases accordingly.

.. Test case: `listBook` +
   Expected: All books in the bookshelf are shown in the leftmost column
.. Test case: `listBook n/Madame` +
   Expected: _Madame Bovary_ should de displayed in the left column. Any other book whose name contains _Madame_ will also be displayed.
.. Test case: `listBook n/Madame n/Madame` +
   Expected: Repeated keywords are acceptable. _Madame Bovary_ should de displayed in the left column. Any other book whose name contains _Madame_ will also be displayed.
.. Test case: `listBook n/Madame n/Bovary` +
   Expected: _Madame Bovary_ and any other books contain _Madame_ or _Bovary_ will be displayed.
.. Test case: `listBook n/Madame n/Pride m/6 m/8` +
   The book _Madame Bovary_ and _Pride and Prejudice_ will be displayed. Some other books will also be displayed according to what you've added into the bookshelf. For example, if you've added _Madame Butterfly_ with a rating 6 into the bookshelf, it will also be displayed. But if you added _Madame Serpent_ with rating 7 into the bookshelf, it will not be displayed as it does not match 'at least one criteria for very dimensions'.
.. Some incorrect listBook commands to try
... `listBook n/Madame Bovary` +
    Keyword given is not a single word. Error isshown in the status message.
... `listBook n/Madame c/nonsense` +
    Prefix `c/` is not recognized, so `Madame c/nonsense` will be regarded as a whole keyword for book name. Since whitespace and '/' are not allowed for keywords, the input is invalid. Error is shown in the status message.
... `listBook m/12` +
    12 is not a valid range for the rating. Error is shown in the status message.
// tag::mtsortBook[]

=== Sorting the booklist

.. Prerequisites: List all book using the `listBook` command. Multiple books on the list.
.. Test case: `SortBook st/rating` +
   Expected: booklist will be sorted with the rating in ascending order.
.. Test case: `SortBook st/rating st/author o/asc o2/des` +
   Expected: The booklist will be sorted in ascending order, if they are having the same rating then it will be sorted in ascending order of author `o2/des` will be ignored as `o/asc` is specified.
.. Test case: `SortBook st/rating st/author o2/des` +
   Expected: The booklist will be sorted in ascending order, if they are having the same rating then it will be sorted in descending order of author `.
.. Some incorrect sort commands to try:

... `sortBook` +
   Error message: Sorting type is not provided.
... `sortBook st/name o1/des o2/asc` +
   Error message: Second sorting type does not exist.

// end::mtsortBook[]
=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Data is saved in `bookshelf.json`, which is under the `data` directory.
.. After the installation, `bookshelf.json` is not present. The file is initialized after the main app runs for the first time. At this point, the file is loaded with the sample data.
.. The data will not be saved automatically. If the user does not exit the program using the `exit` command, the changes will not be kept.
.. If the developer modifies the storage component, to make the data structure and content consistent with the newly updated code, The developer should delete the file before relaunching the app.
.. If the file is corrupted, the developer or the user can manually fix the bookshelf.json to restore the data. However, he or she should stick to the format specified or the data will not be read properly. Therefore, modifying the `bookshelf.json` directly is not encouraged as such behavior will cause unexpected bugs.

// tag::manualtestreview[]
=== Adding a review

. Adding a review with the target book existing in bookshelf
.. Test case: `addReview n/Pride and Prejudice rt/Belief Systems r/Most of the characters believe that nothing matters more than social class...` +

   Expected: the following error message should appear: "The target book does not exist in the book shelf".

. Other invalid commands to try:
.. Test case: `addReview n/Pride and Prejudice rt/Belief%Systems r/Most of the characters believe that nothing matters more than social class...` +
   Expected: error message: "Review titles should contains only alphanumeric characters, spaces, '*', ',', '.', '?', ''', '()' and '&'.
                             And it should not be blank or have more than 50 characters (space included).".
.. Test case: `addReview rt/Belief Systems r/Most of the characters believe that nothing matters more than social class...` +
   Expected: error message: "Invalid command format!
                             addReview: Adds a review to a certain book.
                             Parameters: n/BOOK NAME rt/REVIEW TITLE r/REVIEW
                             Example: addReview n/Alice in Wonderland rt/A great fairytale r/While Lewis Carroll purists will scoff at the aging of his young protagonist..."
