== Introduction

Welcome to TeethHub!
If you are a dental practitioner who prefers to use a Command Line Interface (CLI),
then TeethHub is an application for you!

TeethHub works primarily through a CLI while having elements of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For example, you can select and find patients and records by clicking on them, but you would need to type type the edit command to edit them.
TeethHub allows you to keep track of your patient's particulars along with their dental records.
An image of each patient's teeth will also be displayed according to what you input for each tooth's status(Absent, Problem, Healthy).
In addition to that, TeethHub also allows you to keep track of your upcoming tasks, just like a calendar.

Interested in trying TeethHub out? Check out <<prerequisites>> to see what programs you need in order for TeethHub to work properly.

=== File Management

TeethHub automatically saves all data in AddressBook.json when you close the program.
However, you can manage them manually with Open, Save, Import and Export. +
 +
You can use *open* to open another patient list that you may have transferred over from another computer. +
 +
You can use *save* to save your current patient list to another .json, so that you can transfer them to another computer. +
You can also use *save* to save your current patient list to a .pdf, which is nicer on the eyes.
 +
You can use *Import* to add select patients from another patient list to your current patient list. +
 +
You can use *Export* to save select patients to a .json or .pdf file.

==== open
Opens the file in the specified file path and overwrites the current patients list.
** Note that 'open' always searches inside the data folder.
** You can only open .json files.

Format: `open FILE_PATH`

Examples:

it will be created. Otherwise, it will overwrite the existing file.
** You can only save to .json and .pdf. +
.json files allow you to open or import them. +
.pdf files are easier for humans to read, but you cannot open or import them with TeethHub.

Format: `save FILE_PATH`

Examples:

* `save patients1.json` +
Saves the current patients list to "patients1.json".

* `save february\patients2.pdf` +

=== Teeth Management

==== Brief Description

TeethHub complies with the most popular standard of the three the Dental Numbering Systems utilised in Dentistry - The Universal Numbering System.

==== The Universal Numbering System

ifdef::env-github[]
image::BaseLayer.png[width="200"]
endif::[]

The upper-case letters A through T are used for primary teeth and the
numbers 1 - 32 are used for permanent teeth. The tooth designated "1" is
the maxillary right third molar ("wisdom tooth") and the count continues
along the upper teeth to the left side. Then the count begins at the
mandibular left third molar, designated number 17, and continues along
the bottom teeth to the right side. Each tooth has a unique number or
letter, allowing for easier use on keyboards.

==== Creating and Editing Teeth Layout

There is one template provided by TeethHub: permanent teeth.

All permanent teeth in template will all be present and healthy by default.

* To create a new teeth layout for patient:

** The program automatically creates a new permanent teeth template for new patients added.

* To edit a new specific tooth:

** `goto 1` - Specifies patient 1 to edit his or her teeth status. Enters the record edit mode.

** `teeth edit t/TEETH_LABEL s/STATUS` - Edits the status of the indicated tooth of patient.

** `back` - Exits the record edit mode, and returns to the patient list.

** Valid <Teeth Label> are numbers 1 - 32 (permanent teeth).

** <Status> reflects overall health of the indicated tooth, and valid
<Status> are "healthy", "problem" and "absent".

** <Description> is an optional field that allows you to
write a note describing more detail on the patient’s teeth
health.

=== Task Management
==== taskadd
Adds a task to the application's list of tasks.

Format: `taskadd PARAMETERS`

You can specify information that describes the task you wish to add by
keying in certain tags after the `taskadd` command. Do note the following:

* All parameters have certain patterns that **MUST** be followed. +

* Some parameters are mandatory when adding a task. +

* Non-mandatory tasks will be assigned a default value if not specified
