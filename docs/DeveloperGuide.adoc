By: `Team T12-3`      Since: `Feb 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-3 branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Inventory data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Medicine>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

Given below an object diagram to better illustrate how a medicine is stored in the `Model` component.

.An example of how the medicine "Paracetamol" could be represented by the `Medicine` class.
image::ModelMedicineObjectDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Inventory`, which `Medicine` can reference. This would allow `Inventory` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Medicine` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Medicine Inventory data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section provides you with some description of how certain key features of our product are being implemented.

// tag::batchtable[]
=== Batch table feature
==== Current Implementation

The batch table is mainly driven by `InformationPanel` which extends `UiPart` with an added mechanism to interact with the currently selected medicine.
It implements the following operations:

* `InformationPanel#showSelectedInformation(Medicine medicine)` -- Creates and displays a `BatchTable` that contains information of the selected medicine and its batches.
* `InformationPanel#emptyInformationPanel()` -- Deletes the `BatchTable` being displayed (if any) to show an empty pane.

These operations are hidden and are only triggered when the value of the selected medicine changes.
The `InformationPanel` is initialized with the selected medicine as an `ObservableValue`, and a `ChangeListener` is added to it.
`ChangeListener#changed(ObservableValue<? extends T> observable, T oldValue, T newValue)` is called whenever the value of the selected medicine changes.
Given below is a diagram showing the execution of `InformationPanel` when a change occurs:

image::BatchTableSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the batch table behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. An empty `InformationPanel` is displayed.

Step 2. The user executes `select 1` command to select the 1st medicine in the inventory. Since the new value is not null, `InformationPanel#showSelectedInformation(Medicine medicine)` is called.

[NOTE]
An `update` command will also cause `ChangeListener#changed(ObservableValue<? extends T> observable, T oldValue, T newValue)` to be called as although the same medicine is still selected, the medicine is replaced in the `Inventory` with updated fields.

Step 3. The user executes `find n/Paracetamol ...`. The `find` command deselects the selected medicine and the new value is null. Only `InformationPanel#emptyInformationPanel()` is called.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the batch table executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new `BatchTable` every time a new medicine is selected.
** Pros: Information can be taken from `Model` component during initialization so no extra memory is needed to store table information.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time needed to retrieve the information and build the table, especially if number of batches becomes huge.
* **Alternative 2:** Save created `BatchTables` as a field in `Medicine`.
** Pros: Save time needed for creating the `BatchTable` for faster response time.
** Cons: More memory needed to store `BatchTable`.
// end::batchtable[]

// tag::exportcommand[]
=== Exporting as CSV file format feature via Export Command
==== Current Implementation

The exporting as CSV file format mechanism is facilitated by `CsvWrapper`.
It is build on top of the `Opencsv` Java CSV parser library, licensed under the `Apache 2 OSS License`, so that it integrates with our product. This is done by providing additional operations to support exporting the current Medicine Inventory data shown in the GUI to CSV file format.

There are many additonal operations added in `CsvWrapper` but we will only list the key operations which are the main drivers of the overall implementation of the feature for easier reference and understanding.

The key operations are as follows:

* `CsvWrapper#export()` -- Export the current Medicine Inventory data shown in the GUI to CSV file format.
* `CsvWrapper#createCsvFile(String csvFileName)` -- Creates a CSV file with the file name based on the `csvFileName` input. The file is created in the `exported` directory which is located in the same directory as our product application.
* `CsvWrapper#writeDataToCsv(List currentGuiList)` -- Writes the current Medicine Inventory data shown in the GUI to the CSV file created by the `CsvWrapper#createCsvFile(String csvFileName)` operation.

[Note]
Out of the three key operations stated above, *only* `CsvWrapper#export()` is a _public_ operation available for use by other components. It acts as the main interface which other components use to interact with `CsvWrapper` in order to integrate exporting to CSV file format feature into their own implementation.

Given below is a sequence diagram overview of how these 3 key operations behaves when you execute the export command in order to export the current Medicine Inventory data shown in the GUI to CSV file format:

image::ExportCommandSequenceDiagramOverview.png[width="800"]

Given below is a brief description of how the exporting as CSV file format mechanism behaves as shown in the sequence diagram above:

Step 1: When the user executes the export command, assuming parsing of the command line arguments have already been completed, the `ExportCommand#execute()` operation is called.

Step 2: The `ExportCommand#execute()` operation initialises the `CsvWrapper` with the _file name of the CSV file to be stored_ and _the current model instance_ as its input parameters.

Step 3: The `ExportCommand#execute()` operation then calls `CsvWrapper#export()` operation which is the first key operation which implements the export to CSV file format feature.

Step 4: The `CsvWrapper#export()` operation retrieves the current Medicine Inventory data shown in the GUI by calling the `Model#getFilteredMedicineList()` operation.

Step 5: After retrieving the data, the `CsvWrapper#createCsvFile(String csvFileName)` operation, which is the second key operation, is called. It creates an empty CSV file with the input file name in the `exported` directory as mentioned earlier.

[NOTE]
If a CSV file with the input file name *already exist* in the `exported` directory, a `File already exist` exception will be shown in the `CommandResult` panel of the GUI as a `CommandException` is thrown and the exporting process will stop executing. In other words, the current Medicine Inventory data shown in the GUI would not be exported.

Step 6: After the empty CSV file is created, the `CsvWrapper#writeDataToCsv`, which is the third key operation, is called to process the current Medicine Inventory data retrieved earlier in Step 4 and writes to the CSV file in an organised format for easier reference by the users of the exported CSV file.

Step 7: The current Medicine Inventory data shown in the GUI is exported successfully to CSV file format.

Step 8: The `ExportCommand#execute()` operations returns a `CommandResult` which shows the current list is exported to a CSV file with the input file name.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the exporting as CSV file format feature via the export command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Export all the Medicine Inventory data currently shown in the GUI to CSV file format.
** Pros: Easy to implement and users have a preview of the data before exporting.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual commands each adds an additional parameter to export as CSV file.
** Pros: Individuals can export directly through a single command (e.g. for `filter` command when the export option is enabled, export the filtered Medicine Inventory data immediately without having to retrieve from `Model#getFilteredMedicineList()` operation.
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation and integration of the exporting to CSV file of each individual commands are correct. Furthermore, users are not able preview the data before exporting.

===== Aspect: Data structure/Algorithm/Implementation to support the exporting as CSV file format feature via the export command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate through each of the Medicine in the list retrieved from `Model#getFilterMedicineList()` operation to build the structure in which the data is organised when exported to CSV file format.
** Pros: Easy for developers to understand, especially for those who want to modify the way the data is organised when exported to CSV file format but have no prior knowledge on `Opencsv` Java CSV parser library.
** Cons: The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) and might not be as efficient especially when involving large amounts of data. Furthermore, it does not take full advantage of the more advanced features provided by the `Opencsv` Java CSV parser library.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Opencsv` Java CSV parser library's `StatefulBeanToCsvBuilder` operation for building the structure in which the data is organised from the list retrieved from `Model#getFilterMedicineList()` operation when exported to CSV file format.
** Pros: We do not need to iterate through the list and convert it to a String Array as we can just use the library's `StatefulBeanToCsvBuilder` operation to build the structure from the list by passing the list as a parameter to the operation. Furthermore, the formatting process can be automated using the operation. It is also more efficient in terms of performance according to the library's documentation if ordering of the data exported is not a concern to the developer.
** Cons: Requires prior knowledge on the way in which the library's `StatefulBeanToCsvBuilder` operation works. If the developers want to modify the data exported to be ordered in a specific way, it requires knowledge on the library's `MappingStrategy` related operations which may be complicated for developers new to the library.
[NOTE]
More information on `Opencsv` library's `StatefulBeanToCsvBuilder` operation can be found in the library's link:http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/[documentation].
// end::exportcommand[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInventory`.
It extends `Inventory` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `inventoryStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedInventory#commit()` -- Saves the current inventory state in its history.
* `VersionedInventory#undo()` -- Restores the previous inventory state from its history.
* `VersionedInventory#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone inventory state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitInventory()`, `Model#undoInventory()` and `Model#redoInventory()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInventory` will be initialized with the initial inventory state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single inventory state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th medicine in the inventory. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitInventory()`, causing the modified state of the inventory after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `inventoryStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted inventory state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Paracetamol ...` to add a new medicine. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitInventory()`, causing another modified inventory state to be saved into the `inventoryStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitInventory()`, so the inventory state will not be saved into the `inventoryStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the medicine was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoInventory()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous inventory state, and restores the inventory to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial inventory state, then there are no previous inventory states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoInventory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoInventory()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the inventory to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `inventoryStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest inventory state, then there are no undone inventory states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoInventory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the inventory, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitInventory()`, `Model#undoInventory()` or `Model#redoInventory()`. Thus, the `inventoryStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitInventory()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `inventoryStateList`, all inventory states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/Paracetamol ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire inventory.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the medicine being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of inventory states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedInventory`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

Data encryption is likely to be implemented in future versions of the address book if a reasonable implementation is found.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How data encryption is executed

* **Alternative 1:** Encrypt the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Use pre-existing encryption libraries to encrypt the entire address book.
** Cons: May have performance issues when encrypting/decrypting large amounts of data.
* **Alternative 2:** Only encrypt parts of the address book user selects.
** Pros: More efficient in terms of performance (cuts down on encryption/decryption time).
** Cons: Add `encrypt` and `decrypt` command to allow user to choose what needs to be encrypted and decrypted respectively. Need to encrypt/decrypt different chunks of data correctly.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support data encryption

* **Alternative 1:** Save the entire address book as encrypted data in the database.
** Pros: Data is secure and not viewable without encryption key.
** Cons: Implement log in page for decryption of address book. Require alternative if encryption key is forgotten.
* **Alternative 2:** Save encrypted parts of address book and plaintext in database.
** Pros: Able to salvage some information if encryption key is lost.
** Cons: Need to implement packing/unpacking of encrypted data and plaintext during startup/shutdown.

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::labelcommand[]
=== Label

The exporting of a medicine label to a PDF formatted file is implemented by using Apache PDFBox.

Current implementation:
Under the build.gradle file, we have added new dependency implementation group: 'org.apache.pdfbox', name: 'pdfbox', version: '2.0.13'. This imports the library over to the project for use.

There are many operations available added in the Apache PDFBox, the key operations that we are using would only be:

`PDDocument()` - For creating a new blank PDF file for the medicine details to be exported to.
`PDPage()` - Creates a new PDPage instance for embedding.
`PDPageContentStream(PDDocument , PDPage)` - Provides the ability to write a page content stream.

image::UMLLabelDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the label command behaves in each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. An empty InformationPanel is displayed.

Step 2. The user executes the `label 2` to output the label of the 2nd medicine indexed in the inventory. Since no file name is included in the argument, the default filename 'to_print' is used instead. Then, `LabelCommand#execute()` is called.

Step 3. The user can find the file `to_print` under the main folder.

Step 4. The user executes `label 1 f/file_to_print` to output the label of the 1st medicine indexed in the inventory. The `LabelCommandParser` class will be able to tokenize and read the desired file name. Then, `LabelCommand#execute()` is called.

Step 5. The user can find a new file `file_to_print` under the same main folder.

[NOTE]
If the user would execute another `label 1`, the original `to_print` file will be replaced with the information of the 1st medicine indexed in the inventory. Users are warned in the User Guide to be caution about overwriting files.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: How label executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new `PDFDocument` every time a medicine it to be labeled.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Uses more of the user computer memory space as it creates the temporary file.
* **Alternative 2:** Find the existing PDF file and edit.
** Pros: Will use less memory.
** Cons: We have to read the existing file which requires more time to execute.

// end::labelcommand[]

// tag::warningpanel[]
=== Warning Panel
==== Current Implementation

The warning panel is driven by the `MainWindow` which creates `WarningPanel` that extends `UiPart`. The `WarningPanel` then creates two `WarningListView` where the list of expiring medicine and list of medicine low in stock will reside. The lists updates themselves when there are any changes made to the inventory. Each item of a list is represented by a `WarningCard`.

The following are implemented:

* `WarningPanel#setUpVBox(ObservableList<Medicine>, ObservableList<Medicine>)` -- Sets up the `VBox` (vertical box) where the lists will be displayed in, and creates two `WarningListView` objects. Each `ObservableList` is passed into a `WarningListView`, along with a `String` descriptor of the list, as such: `WarningListView(ObservableList<Medicine>, String "expiry")`

* `WarningListView` extends `UiPart` -- Upon construction, `ListView#setItems(ObservableList<T> value)` and `ListView#setCellFactory(Callback<ListView<T>, ListCell<T>> value)` are called.

** `ListView#setItems(ObserverableList<Medicine> medicineList)` -- Sets the `ObservableList` whose items will be displayed in the `ListView`. Due to `ObservableList` semantics, the `ListView` automatically updates when there are changes made to the inventory.

** `ListView#setCellFactory(Callback<ListView<Medicine>, ListCell<Medicine>> listView -> new WarningListViewCell())` -- Sets the cell factory for the `ListView` within the class `WarningListView`.
*** `WarningListViewCell` extends `ListCell<T>` -- It overrides `ListCell#updateItem(T item, boolean empty)` allowing customization by creating a `WarningCard` for each cell.

* `WarningCard` extends `UiPart` -- Sets the fields (eg. name of medicine, quantity, expiry date) to be displayed in the warning list view cell.

The following sequence diagram shows how `WarningPanel` is executed when MediTab is initialized:

image::WarningPanelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Explanation of the sequence diagram above:

Step 1. When the user launches the application for the first time, `MainWindow` is called during the setting up of the GUI. Within the `MainWindow`. A `WarningPanel`, with the two `ObservableList` to be displayed as parameters, is then created.

Step 2. `WarningPanel#setUpVBox` is called to create two `WarningListView` so that the `ObservableList` can be displayed. Each list will be passed into one `WarningListView` as a parameter, along with a `String` descriptor of that list. For simplicity, the construction of only one `WarningListView` is shown.

Step 3. Within the `WarningListView`'s constructor, `ListView#setItems` and `ListView#setCellFactory` are called to set up this `ListView<Medicine>`.

[NOTE]
Any command that modifies the inventory will result in a change in the `ObservableList` being set using `ListView#setItems`. This ensures that the `ListView` is kept up to date with the most recent version of the inventory.

Step 4. The cell factory creates cells by creating a `WarningListViewCell`. This creates a `WarningCard` for every item in the `ListView` supplied. These cells are displayed in the GUI.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Construction of the lists displayed by the warning panel

Two `ObservableLists` are required, one to display names of medicine expiring soon and the other to display medicine low in stock.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create two `ObservableList` in the `Model` by filtering the main medicine list from the versioned inventory.
** Pros: Easy to change predicate for filtration when needed, making it possible to have user defined thresholds for filtration.
** Cons: Need to create a new filtered `ObservableList` every time the predicate used for filtering changes. This would be the case when the user sets his/her own threshold.

* **Alternative 2:** Pass the medicine list into the `Ui` for filtration.
** Pros: Simple to implement and filter with the default predicates (i.e. thresholds for expiration and low stock) to obtain the two lists.
** Cons: No separation of concerns. Not possible to set user defined thresholds for either list.
// end::warningpanel[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/InventoryParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/InventoryParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAddressBookStorage.java[`JsonAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

Our target user, Isabelle, is a pharmacist whose job is to dispense and manage the inventory of the medication. Sadly, she spends a significant part of her day managing her clinic’s inventory to ensure that it is adequately stocked daily. It is crucial that there is not an oversupply of medicine due to their short shelf lives, while expiring products are to be identified and dispose of. As Isabelle has many tasks to complete daily, it is important that she can manage the inventory efficiently.

*Value proposition*: streamline and provide an organized overview of medical inventory management.

== Non Functional Requirements

. User Constraints
.. The product caters users with a preference for typing commands over the command line. Only limited GUI interactions are available as the focus is on the command line interface.
.. The product is meant only for single user usage. i.e, any features (e.g. profile switching) should only be limited to a single user. Using such features to support mulitple users is not recommended.

. Data
.. User should have read and write permissions for data stored on the local machine. i.e, expert users can edit the data file without the application.
.. Third party database management systems (e.g. MySQL, Postgres) are not permitted.

. Working Environment
.. The product should work on all mainstream OS.
.. Connection to external APIs is not recommended, although the usage of reliable external APIs is permissible. In such cases, a fallback should be implemented should the connection fail.

. Portability
.. The product should work without the need for additional software. `.jar` package will be used for the product release.

. Testability
.. Avoid implementing features that are difficult to test manually and automatically. i.e, avoid dependence on remote APIs as their behaviours are beyond our control.
.. Due to the project's constraints, audio related features were not taken into consideration. Avoid any features using audio indicators.
