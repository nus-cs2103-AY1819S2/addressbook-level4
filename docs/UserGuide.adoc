== Introduction

BookSquirrel is for those who *want to keep a record of books they've read*. More importantly, BookSquirrel is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, BookSquirrel can get your book management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `bookSquirrel.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The main window should appear in a few seconds, as shown in the screenshot below.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
E.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`addBook`**`n/Alice in Wonderland a/Lewis Carroll m/5 t/fantasy t/fairy tale` : adds a book named `Alice in Wonderland` to the record. The book is written by `Lewis Carroll`, with a rating of 5, and labeled with tags `fairy tale` and `fantasy`.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
