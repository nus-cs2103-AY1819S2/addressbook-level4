== Setting up

Go through the following sections to set up GradTrak.

=== Checking prerequisites

Ensure that each of the following software has been installed.

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project

Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your computer.

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors.
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully.
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error.
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way).

=== Verifying the setup
Follow the instructions below to verify that the setup is successful.

. Run `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure all of them pass.

=== Configurating the project

Go through the following sections to configure the project.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order.
Follow the instructions below to rectify this issue.

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

Follow the instructions below when you are ready to start coding.

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
The following sections explain the design of GradTrak.

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence and connecting them with one another.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The user interface (UI) of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The model holding the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The storage which reads data from and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components above:

* Defines its Application Programming Interface (API) in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see class diagram in Section 2.3) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteModuleTaken.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `GradTrakParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteModuleTakenSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `UserInfo` object that represents user's information such as `Course` and `SemLimit`
* stores the GradTrak data.
* stores a filtered list of `ModuleInfo`, `RecModule` that represents a list of modules NUS offers
* stores a list of `RequirementStatus` that keep tracks of the status of the requirement of the Course
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ModuleTaken>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `GradTrak`, which `ModuleTaken` can reference. This would allow `GradTrak` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `ModuleTaken` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
Within the `Storage` component there are *2* types of storage classes: +
1. read and write storage +
2. read only storage

==== Read and write storage
.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]
//TODO: update class diagram
The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref`, `UserInfo` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the GradTrak data in json format and read it back.

==== Read-only storage
image::moduleinfostorage.png[width="800"]
.Structure of read-only storage components
image::CourseStorage.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/moduleinfostorage/ModuleInfoStorage.java[`ModuleInfoStorage.java`],
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/coursestorage/CourseStorage.java[`CourseStorage.java`]

* loads `ModuleInfoStorage` and `CourseStorage` from json format into memory

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::displaymod[]
=== Displaymod feature
==== Current Implementation

The `displaymod` is a search function that displays all available information with regards to the module codes the user types
into the command box.

When the application is launched, a JSON file containing all of NUS module information is then converted
into an Object Class called ModuleInfo individually and stored into an ObservableList<ModuleInfo> called ModuleInfoList.

image::ConversionModuleInfo.png[width="800"]

The usage of ModuleInfoList is only temporary as it is passed into `ModelManager` and then converted into an ObservableList<>.

[NOTE]
The purpose of having ModuleInfoList is not only for temporary use; it also serves as form of Error handling if the application
is unable to find the location of the JSON file containing all of the module information, a blank ModuleInfoList is handed to the
ModelManager.

image::Observable.png[width="800"]

This is done as `ObservableList<>` comes with a `FilteredList<>` feature: which wraps an ObservableList and filters the contents
based on `predicates`.

* `Predicates` -- All search keywords i.e *Module Code* is saved as a list of `predicates`.

This allows for easier search throughout the list of all Module Information, as the User can search for multiple modules in
a single search.

The FilteredList is then collected and the ModuleInfo Objects will be formatted into Strings so that the information required
is displayed by the UI.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Displaymod executes
* **Current Implementation :** Searches based on Module Codes Only
** Pros: Searches is slightly faster since its only based on Module Codes
** Cons: Limited search since it requires User to know Module Codes beforehand.

* **Future Implementation :** Search based on keywords
** Pros: User can search for Modules based on keywords thus require no prior knowledge on a particular module code
** Cons: Have to combine all module information into a single String and search for keywords; slower searches.

==== Aspect: Data Structure Used
* **Current Implementation :** `ObservableList<>` is used
** Pros: Allows for `FilteredList<>` to be used based on predicates; easy implementation.
** Cons: Requires additional classes to be implemented to handle the use of `Predicates`.

* **Alternative :** Sticking to the `ArrayList<>`
** Pros: Easy to handle as it is a simple data structure.
** Cons: Harder to search for specific Keywords(future implementation)


// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedGradTrak`.
It extends `GradTrak` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `gradTrakStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedGradTrak#commit()` -- Saves the current GradTrak state in its history.
* `VersionedGradTrak#undo()` -- Restores the previous GradTrak state from its history.
* `VersionedGradTrak#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone GradTrak state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitGradTrak()`, `Model#undoGradTrak()` and `Model#redoGradTrak()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedGradTrak` will be initialized with the initial GradTrak state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single GradTrak state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th module in the GradTrak. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitGradTrak()`, causing the modified state of the GradTrak after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `GradTrakStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted GradTrak state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add c/CS2103T ...` to add a new module. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitGradTrak()`, causing another modified GradTrak state to be saved into the `gradTrakStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitGradTrak()`, so the GradTrak state will not be saved into the `gradTrakStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the module was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoGradTrak()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous GradTrak state, and restores the GradTrak to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial GradTrak state, then there are no previous GradTrak states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoGradTrak()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoGradTrak()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the GradTrak to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `gradTrakStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest GradTrak state, then there are no undone GradTrak states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoGradTrak()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the GradTrak, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitGradTrak()`, `Model#undoGradTrak()` or `Model#redoGradTrak()`. Thus, the `gradTrakStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitGradTrak()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `gradTrakStateList`, all GradTrak states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add c/CS2103T ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire GradTrak.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of GradTrak states.
** Pros: Easy for less experienced developers to understand.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedGradTrak`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::CourseRequirement[]
=== Display Course Requirement feature
==== Current Implementation
The `displayreq` command allows the users to see all their course requirements and also check if the modules they have
taken fulfils them. This command is currently facilitated by 2 classes in `Model`, `CourseRequirement` and
`RequirementStatus`:

===== `CourseRequirement` Interface
As there are many different kinds of course requirements that can be found in NUS, it is difficult to iron down the common characteristic
they all share. This can be seen in the examples found below:


.Computer Systems Team Project Requirement
image::nus_requirement.PNG[width ="800"]

.Focus Area Requirement
image::nus_requirement2.PNG[width="800"]

For the requirement shown in Figure 9, students just have to complete at least one of CS3203 or
CS3216 and CS3217 or CS3281 and CS3282. Whereas for the requirement in Figure 10, students have to fulfill
all of the conditions stated above. Even though these two conditions might seem quite different,
we are still able to draw some key observations about what they have in common:

. Each requirement is composed of conjunction or disjunction of condition and each condition can
be composed by conjunction and disjunction of other simpler conditions.
. Conditions that cannot be further broken down into simpler conditions usually contains information on the list of
modules that can be used to satisfy the condition and how many of the modules should be completed to satisfy the
condition.

These observations gives us some insight as to how we should design the interface. As such, the `CourseRequirement` interface follows a `Composite` design pattern. This is favoured as it allows
us to treat individual and composition of `CourseRequirement` objects uniformly. The diagram below gives an overview of
how `CourseRequirement` is implemented.

.`CourseRequirement` class diagram
image::CompositeDesignPattern.png[width="800"]

This interface is implemented by 2 subclasses - `PrimitiveRequirement` and `CompositeRequirement`.
The `PrimitiveRequirement` is the simplest building block for `CourseRequirement`. Each `PrimitiveRequirement` stores a
list of `Condition` objects. A `Condition` object stores a `Java` `Pattern` and an `int`, `minToSatisfy`. A `Condition`
is satisfied if there are at least `minToSatisfy` many distinct
`ModuleInfoCode` that matches `Pattern` in it. `PrimitiveRequirement` is satisfied only if all `Condition` objects in the list are
fulfilled.

For instance in Figure 9, a suitable `Condition` for completing CS3216 and CS3217 would be
a `Pattern` that accepts only CS3216 or CS3217, and a `minToSatisfy` of 2.



The `CompositeRequirement` can replicate the behaviour of more complex course requirements. Each `CompositeRequirement`
object contains two `CourseRequirement` objects. It also contains a `LogicalConnector` enumeration
that tells the `CompositeRequirement` how two different `CourseRequirement` are composed using logical operations. For instance, for
a list of `ModuleInfoCode` to satisfy a `CompositeRequirement` that has a `AND` `LogicalConnector`, the list must
satisfy the both `CourseRequirement` objects contained in `CompositeRequirement`.

There currently 3 methods that `CourseRequirement` provides information to the user:

* `isFulfilled` -- a method that accepts a list of `ModuleInfoCode` and returns a `boolean` to indicate whether the list of
`ModuleInfoCode` can satisfy the all the `CourseRequirement`

** In `PrimitiveRequirement`, this is achieved by checking whether all the `ModuleInfoCode` satisfies all the
`Condition` stored in it.

** In `CompositeRequirement`, this is dependent on the `LogicalConnector` it has. It would return the value of
first `CourseRequirement#isFulfilled` `LogicalConnector` second `CourseRequirement#isFulfilled`.

* `percentageFulfilled` -- a method that also accepts a list of ModuleInfoCode returns a `double` value that represents the
percentage of completion of the `CourseRequirement`
** In `PrimitiveRequirement`, this is achieved by calculating the number of distinct modules that satisfy at least
1 of the `Condition` in the list and divided by the sum of `minToSatisfy`.
** This depends on the `LogicalConnector` in `CompositeRequirement`. If it is a `OR` connector, we return the maximum
of the two. The `AND` logical connector returns the average of the degree of completion for both requirements.
* `getUnfulfilled` -- a method that accepts a list of `ModuleInfoCode` and returns a list of RegExes from where none of the
`ModuleInfoCode` matches. This method is used in the recommend feature.

===== `RequirementStatus` Class
The `RequirementStatus` is an association class that links a `CourseRequirement` with `VersionedGradTrak` in `Model`.
This can be seen in the class diagram below:

.`RequirementStatus` class diagram
image::RequirementStatusClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


It also stores the result of the associated `CourseRequirement` object's `isFulfilled` and `percentageFulfilled`
methods acting on the list of `ModuleInfoCode`.


Below is a sequence of execution when `displayreq` command is executed by the user:

1. `Model#updateRequirementStatusList` is called. This clears the pre-existing `RequirementStatusList`
and fills it with new `RequirementStatus` objects based on current `Course` and `ModulesTakenList`.

2. `UI` calls `getRequirementStatusList` from `Logic` and retrieves the updated `RequirementStatusList`
from `Model`. This list is displayed in the `ResultPanel`.

The sequence diagram below summarises the execution as described above.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `Condition` class checks if it is fulfilled.
* **Current choice: Checking `Condition` fulfilled by only using `ModuleInfoCode` of
`ModuleTaken`**
** Pros: Easy to implement since we are restricting scope to only checking whether strings match
pattern in `Condition`
** Cons: Possibility that the `CourseRequirement` class fails to check requirements that does not
 not depend on `ModuleInfoCode`


* ** Alternative: Checking Requirement fulfilled by accessing any attribute of `ModuleTaken`**
** Pros: Increased flexibility and easier to replicate actual NUS requirements that does not depend
on `ModuleInfoCode`
** Cons: Increased complexity to implement `CourseRequirement` class properly.

We chose the current choice over the alternative due to time constraints in the project. Moreover, our current choice
is sufficient to replicate most NUS requirements accurately.

===== Aspect: Choice of information stored in `Condition` class
* **Current choice: `Condition` class stores a `Pattern` to check whether a requirement is satisfied**
** Pros: Compact representation of which `ModuleInfoCode` fulfills the requirement
** Cons: Difficult to find the correct regular expression for some `Condition.`

* **Alternative: `Condition` class stores an exact list of `String` to check whether a condition is satisfied**
** Pros: Easy and interpretive to use.
** Cons: Might need to store a long list of `String` if many modules can fulfil the `Condition` eg: General Education
Modules

We chose our current choice over the alternative as it takes up much fewer space to store. Moreover, storing a pattern
also improves performance time since each `ModuleInfoCode` is matched against a `Pattern` instead a list of `String`
objects.

==== Possible Improvements
. Allow users to create and export their own `Course` and `CourseRequirement` objects.
. Allow `Condition` to check its fulfillment access other attributes of a `ModuleTaken` object in the future.
//end::CourseRequirement[]

// tag::rec[]
=== Module recommendation feature

The module recommendation feature displays modules which the user is recommended to read based on the current module plan
and specific course requirements. It generates a list of module codes together with their corresponding titles and requirement
types satisfied. The entire list is displayed on the Result Panel upon entering the `rec` command.

==== Current implementation

Each recommended module is represented by a `RecModule` which contains a unique `ModuleInfo` and its corresponding
`CourseReqType` satisfied, as shown in the diagram below.

.`RecModule` class diagram
image::RecModuleClassDiagram.png[width="400"]


When `ModelManager` is initialised, `Model#getObservableRecModuleList` is called which generates an
`ObservableList` of `RecModule` , one for each module in the entire `ModuleInfoList`. This list is wrapped in a `FilteredList`,
which is further wrapped in a `SortedList`, both stored in `ModelManager`. At this point, all `RecModule` in the list contain an empty `CourseReqType` field.

When the `rec` command is entered, the sequence of execution is as follows:

.  `Model#updateRecModuleList` is called, which creates a `RecModulePredicate` given the user's `Course` and `GradTrak`, and a `RecModuleComparator`.
.  The `RecModulePredicate` is applied to the `FilteredList` of `RecModule`. In each test:
.. An `EligibleModulePredicate` which takes in `GradTrak` tests if the `ModuleInfo` of this `RecModule` is eligible to be read.
If the module is already present in GradTrak or does not have its prerequisites satisfied, this `RecModule` is filtered out.
.. The `ModuleInfoCode` (call it `codeToTest`) of the `RecModule` is retrieved. +
A `nonFailedCodeList` of `ModuleInfoCode` corresponding to non-failed `ModuleTaken` (already passed or to be read in a future semester) is also retrieved from `GradTrak`.
.. The `codeToTest` is then passed into `Course#getCourseReqTypeOf`, which in turn calls `CourseRequirement#canFulfill` for each `CourseRequirement` listed in `Course`.
 A list of `CourseReqType` that the `codeToTest` can satisfy is returned.
This `courseReqTypeList` is sorted by the priority of `CourseReqType` as defined in the `enum` class: `CORE`, `BD`, `IE`, `FAC`, `GE`, `UE`.
.. For each `CourseReqType` in the `courseReqTypeList` (highest priority first):
... `Course#isCodeContributing` is called, which takes in the `CourseReqType`, `nonFailedCodeList` and `codeToTest`.
... For each `CourseRequirement` listed in `Course` corresponding to the given `CourseReqType`, `CourseRequirement#getUnfulfilled`
is called which takes in the `nonFailedCodeList` and returns an `unfulfilledRegexList` of RegExes not satisfied.
... If the `codeToTest` matches any of the RegExes in the
`unfulfilledRegexList`, `Course#isCodeContributing` returns `true` and the loop for `courseReqTypeList` terminates.
.. The `CourseReqType` of highest priority satisfied by `codeToTest` is then set into the `RecModule`. However, if the `codeToTest` does not
contribute to any of the `CourseRequirement` listed in `Course`, this `RecModule` is filtered out.
. The `RecModuleComparator` is applied to the `SortedList` of `RecModule`. It sorts the list in decreasing priority of the
`CourseReqType` satisfied by the `RecModule`. Those `RecModule` with equal priority are sorted by module level (the first numerical digit of its `ModuleInfoCode`),
considering that lower level modules are usually read first. In the case of equal priority and module level, lexicographical sorting of its `ModuleInfoCode` is used.
. The `SortedList` of `RecModule` is retrieved from `ModelManager` and displayed to the user in the Result Panel.

If there are changes to `GradTrak` (adding, editing or deleting modules) or `Course` (changing the course of study), the `rec` command
must be run again to reflect the updated recommendation list.

The sequence diagrams summarising the above execution are shown below.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Sorting of recommendation list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Recommendation list is sorted by a fixed order of `CourseReqType` priority as defined in the `enum` class**
** Pros: Easy to implement and modify
** Cons: User may have his own order of priority that differs from the default one

* **Alternative 2: Recommendation list can be sorted by a custom order defined by the user**
** Pros: User can sort the list according to his own preferences
** Cons: Difficult to implement if several parameters for sorting is allowed; input method for the custom order is problematic

===== Aspect: Format of recommendation
* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Display a list of all eligible modules that contribute to course requirements**
** Pros: User has a greater freedom of choice
** Cons: User may be confused or unable to decide if the list is too long

* **Alternative 2: Display `n` modules for each semester, where `n` is decided by the user**
** Pros: User can plan modules for specific semesters easily and quickly
** Cons: Algorithm required to plan for all semesters can be complex; user may not prefer the given plan


==== Possible Improvements
. Allow the user to display a module's information (from `displaymod` command) using its index in the recommendation list
. Allow the user to add a module to the module plan using its index in the recommendation list
// end::rec[]

// tag::semesterlimits[]
=== Semester CAP and workload management feature

==== Current Implementation
Users are able to set their preferred minimum and maximum CAP limits for each semester. They are also able to set the minimum and maximum workload limits for each semester in terms of the number of hours per week in terms of lectures, tutorials, labs, projects, and preparation.

The current stored semester limits will be loaded from the GradTrak.json file into a list of `SemLimit` Objects for each semester on app startup.
If the user has not set any limits, the json file will contain a list with default limit values.

Users able to set the expected minimum and maximum grade for each module they take, as well as the number of workload hours.
The `EditCommand` is used to set the grades and workload expected using an single argument for each variable.

Users can check if their expected grades and workload per semester falls within their preferred limits.
A class `LimitChecker` handles the computation of CAP and total workload of the semesters and generates a table in HTML with the information computed.
//end::semesterlimits[]

// tag::semestertracking[]
=== Current Semester Tracking

==== Current Implementation
Modules taken before the current semester must have a finalized grade such that

when the user tries to shift the current semester forward, the app will check through all the modules taken before the current semester to ensure that the maximum and minimum expected grades are set to be the same.
or else the `cursem` command will fail and be rejected with an error message

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affect how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default values*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affect how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default values*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the third one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more information on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as how they are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version `courseReqCredits` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version courseReqCredits. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, GradTrak depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant `courseReqCredits` of contacts
* prefer desktop applications over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI applications

*Value proposition*: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven application

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the application manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy it into an empty folder.
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with an empty module plan. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a module

. Deleting a module while all `moduleTaken` are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all `moduleTaken` using the `list` command.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First module is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted module are shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No module is deleted. Error details are shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size or negative) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
