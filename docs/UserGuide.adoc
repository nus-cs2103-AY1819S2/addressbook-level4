== Introduction

GradTrak is an application designed for NUS students to easily track their graduation progress. It is currently only limited to courses offered in School of Computing. The primary method of input is Command Line Interface (CLI) which will benefit students of SoC as they generally type quickly. Proceed to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `GradTrak.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Module Plan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`update`* : retrieves the latest information of all modules from CORS.
* **`add`**`c/cs1010 s/y1s1 g/A` : adds the module "CS1010", taken in Y1S1 with grade A, into the list of completed modules.
* **`delete`**`1` : deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add c/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/cs1010`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `c/MODULE_CODE [g/GRADE_OBTAINED]` can be used as `c/cs1010 g/A` or as `c/cs1010`.
====

=== View all other commands : `help`

Displays a list of all available commands. +
Format: `help`

=== Set course of study: `set`

Sets the course of study the user is undertaking. +
Format: `set COURSE` +

* `CEG` - Computer Engineering
* IS` - Information System
* `IFS` - Infocomm Security
****

Examples:

* `set IFS` +
Sets course of study to Infocomm Security.

* `set CS` +

Input the corresponding digit for the desired FA: +
.  Algorithms & Theory
.  Artificial Intelligence
.  Computer Graphics and Games
.  Computer Security
.  Database Systems
.  Multimedia Information Retrieval
.  Networking and Distributed Systems
.  Parallel Computing
.  Programming Languages
.  Software Engineering
User wants to choose focus area to be Artificial Intelligence so inputs `2`


=== Add module: `add`

Adds a module to the module plan based on the given module code, semester taken and expected / obtained grade. +
Format: `add c/MODULE_CODE s/SEMESTER [g/MIN_GRADE_EXPECTED MAX_GRADE_EXPECTED]` +
or +

****
* Possible grade options are the standard letter grades (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B- etc.) and IC, EXE, CS, CU, W, S, U.
* Adding an existing module with the same semester is not allowed.
****

Examples:

* `add c/cs2103t s/y2s2` +
Adds CS2103T, to be taken in Y2S2, to the module plan.

* `add c/cs2103t s/y2s2 g/B-` +
Adds CS2103T, taken in Y2S2 with grade B-, to the module plan.

=== Edit module: `edit`

Edits the semester and/or grade of a module in the module plan based on the given module code or index in the most recently displayed list. +
Format: `edit c/MODULE_CODE [s/NEW_SEMESTER] [g/NEW_GRADE_OBTAINED]` +
        or +
        `edit INDEX [s/NEW_SEMESTER] [g/NEW_GRADE_OBTAINED]` +

****
* At least one field to be edited must be given.
****

Examples:

* `edit c/cs2103t s/y2s2` +
Changes the semester taken of CS2103T to Y2S2.

* `edit 2 g/A+` +
Changes the grade obtained of the second module in the most recently displayed list to A+.

=== Delete module: `delete`

Removes a module from the module plan based on the given module code OR index on the most recently displayed list. +
Format: `delete INDEX` +
or +
`delete c/MODULE_CODE`

****
* Shows a message if the given module code is not found.
****

Examples:

* `delete c/cs2103t` +

* `delete 1` +
Deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.

=== Display module information: `displaym`

3 options to display module information, e.g. course description, prerequisites and courses succeeding the modules. +
Format: `displaym o/OPTIONS [MORE_ARGUMENTS]`

3 modes for o/OPTIONS include:

.  `o/all`
* Display all modules completed.

.  `o/info m/MODULE_CODE`
* Display information about a module and modules preceding and succeeding it

.  `o/info k/KEYWORDS [n/NUMBER]`
