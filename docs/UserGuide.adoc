== Introduction

* UniLA is a desktop utilities application designed for	NUS students who are typing oriented.
* UniLA provides an efficient and convenient solution for managing contact list and event list, contact interactions, planning meetings, setting up reminders, etc.
* The application is primarily concerned with CLI (Command Line Interface) Interaction, with a simple and intuitive GUI provided.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `W16-1 UniLA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your UniLA.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the UniLA.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Contact List Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

// tag::switch[]

=== Switching views: `switch`

Changes the view in the window. The default upon startup is in Contacts view. Running this command will toggle between contacts and events view.

Format: `switch`

Commands that require indices of one particular view as arguments may require you to switch to that view first. In those cases, switch to the appropriate view before running the command.

// end::switch[]

=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the UniLA +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

=== Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the UniLA. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the UniLA. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +

// tag::upgradefindcommand-yinya998[]
=== Locating persons by any field: `find`

Finds people whose fields contain any of the input keywords.
Searching can be done with or without prefix.
When searched without prefix, people whose fields that contain any matching keywords will be returned.
When searched with prefix, people whose corresponding fields that contain any matching keywords will be returned.

Format1: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Format2: `find prefix/KEYWORD, [MORE KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* If there is no prefix, all fields will be searched.
****


These are 3 search patterns that are utilized be the `find` command: +

1. Exact keyword match - Matches the input keyword with exact keywords found in people's fields.

2. Fuzzy keyword match - Matches the input keyword to people's fields that have higher than 0.7 similarity. The similarity is calculated based on Levenshtein Distance. Further explanation is provided in the developer guide.

3. Wildcard keyword match - Matches the input keyword with wildcard character *. * represents any number of alphanumeric characters consisting of 0-9, a-z and A-Z.

*Searching results are displayed in the following format:* +
n persons listed: +
 Exact Search: +
 [NAME]… +
 Fuzzy Search: +
 [NAME]… +
 Wildcard Search: +
 [NAME]… +

[TIP]
 There are three parts of executing `find` command. The input keywords are first searched with exact string match, then fuzzy search, and finally wildcard search.
 Any results displayed in the previous searching stage will not be shown in the next searching stage. +
 For example, if person Alice is found in exact string match, she will not be displayed in fuzzy search result. This is to avoid message duplication.

Examples:

* `find victoria` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields that contain keyword `victoria` in exact search. For example, person whose name is `Victoria` or person who lives in `Victoria Street`. +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields that have keywords similar to `victoria`. For example, person whose tags containing the keyword `Victory`. +

* `find Serangon doctor` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields that contain keywords `Serangon` **or** `doctor`  +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields that have keywords similar to `Serangon` **or** `doctor` +

* `find t/owemoney friends` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose tags that contain keywords `owemoney` **or** `friends` +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose tags that have keywords similar to to `owemoney` **or** `friends` +

* `find \*@gmail.com` +
In exact search: Returns any person whose fields that contain keywords `*@gmail.com` +
In fuzzy search: Returns any person whose fields that have keywords similar to `\*@gmail.com` +
In wildcard search: Returns any person whose fields that have keywords match regex `*@gmail.com` +

=== Planning a meeting : `meet`

This command allows users to automatically create a meeting event among certain people, removing the need to siphon through all the events just to find a common available timeslot among contacts to meet. The command will:

****
* search for the earliest available timeslot among the requested people to meet
* create the meeting event in the event list
* connect the requested people to the event and
* set the details of the event (such as name, description etc.) as requested.
****

Format: `meet INDEX TAGS n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION v/VENUE l/LABEL s/STARTDATETIME e/ENDDATETIME duration/D H M S block/BLOCK` where

****
* `INDEX` denotes the indices of the people in the contact list the user wants to meet. For example, entering indices `1 2` will retrieve the 1st and 2nd persons in the contact list.
* `TAGS` denotes the tags of the people in the contact list the user wants to meet. For example, entering tags `t/friends` will retrieve all persons with the `friends` tag.
* `NAME` is the name of the new meeting event
* `DESCRIPTION` is the description of the new meeting event
* `VENUE` is the venue of the new meeting event, and
* `LABEL` is the label given to this new meeting event.
* `D` is the number of days the event will have
* `H` is the number of hours the event will have
* `M` is the number of minutes the event will have, and
* `S` is the number of seconds the event will have.
* `STARTDATETIME` is the earliest possible start date and time of the new meeting event
* `ENDDATETIME` is the latest possible end date and time of the new meeting event, and
* `BLOCK` denotes the block of *time* that the new meeting event *must* be in.
****

and must abide by these restrictions:

****
* `INDEX` *must be positive integers* 1, 2, 3...
* `TAGS` *must be valid alphanumeric tag names*, each with the `t/` prefix, such as `t/tagOne t/tagTwo`
* Duplicates are allowed but are ignored
* At least two valid persons were specified
* `NAME` must be a valid event name
* `DESCRIPTION` must be a valid event description
* `VENUE` must be a valid event venue and
* `LABEL` must be a valid alphanumeric event label.
* `D`, `H`, `M`, `S` are all integers
* Individually, `D`, `H`, `M` and `S` can be negative
* The specified duration in its *entirety* is nonnegative.
* Both `STARTDATETIME` and `ENDDATETTIME` are valid `DateTime`s
* `BLOCK` is a valid `Block` (see Defining a Valid Block).
****

The earliest this event would be created will be at the start of the next hour from the time the command was run. That is, if user ran the command on 1st Jan 2019 at 4:59pm, the earliest meeting event that could be created would be on 1st Jan 2019 at 5pm.

*Note*: All fields are optional, but at least two valid persons must be specified. If a field is unspecified, a default value is used.

*Note*: Entering multiple tags create and/or relationships, more specifically, if a user specifies two tags, `tagone` and `tagtwo`, then every person who has `tagone` *and/or* `tagtwo` will be retrieved (think of it as a union of two sets, not the intersection).

Example:

`meet 1 2 t/friends t/colleagues n/Snooker competition d/Playing snooker again v/SAFRA Toa Payoh l/snooker duration/0 8 -30 0 s/2019-05-01 00:00:00 e/2019-05-07 00:00:00 block/09:00 18:00`

creates an event whereby:

****
* The event will have the first and second people in the contact list, and all persons with the `friends` or `colleagues` tag, or both
* The event's name is `Snooker competition`

****

===== Defining a Valid Block:
A block denotes the block of time that the new meeting event must be in.

It contains two timings, and possibly a `!` symbol, "negating" the block.

A block must be written as:
`block/<Optional ! symbol><Either two sets of timings in HH:MM separated by space, or a keyword>`

Examples:

* `block/00:00 13:32` +
indicates that the new meeting event *must* fall within 12am to 1.32pm within the same day (counting clockwise).
* `block/!22:00 04:00` +
indicates that the new meeting event *must not* fall within 10pm to 4am the next day, or effectively, the new meeting event must fall within 4am to 10pm within the same day.

Instead of entering two timings, users may opt to enter a keyword instead. The following is the full list of available keywords:

****
* `morning` denotes 6am to 12pm
* `afternoon` denotes 12pm to 6pm
* `evening` denotes 6pm to 8pm
* `night` denotes 8pm to 12am the next day
* `midnight` denotes 12am to 6am
* `school` denotes school hours, i.e. 8am to 6pm
* `breakfast` denotes 7am to 10am
* `lunch` denotes 12pm to 2pm
* `dinner` denotes 5pm to 8pm
* `supper` denotes 9pm to 1am the next day
* `brunch` denotes 10am to 1pm.
****

Examples:

* `block/breakfast` +
indicates that the new meeting event must fall within breakfast hours, defined to be 7am to 10am.
* `block/!night` +
indicates that the new meeting event must not fall within night time, defined to be 8pm to 12am the next day. Effectively, the event must fall within 12am to 8pm of the same day.
