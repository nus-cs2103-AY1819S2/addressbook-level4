Hello there! My name is Ian and I am one of the developers for the Battleship game. The following document is a Project Portfolio Page of my contributions to Battleship.

== Project Overview

Battleship is the product of a semester-long project for the CS2103T (Software Engineering) module that I read at the National University of Singapore. My team was tasked with adapting an existing phone addressbook application into an application of our choice. Our game, Battleship, is a revival of the classic retro game Battleships, where players try to destroy each other's ships by guessing the positions of their opponent's battleships.

In Battleship, however, players have the opportunity to use both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to play the game. The GUI was created with JavaFX and the application code was rigorously tested to ensure a high quality of code.

My role in the team was to design and implement the Ship Management feature. The feature allows players to manage their ships during the game. The Ship Manager feature consists of the commands `put`, `list` and `listTags`. Together, these three commands provide an intuitive way for players to interact with their own ships. The following sections illustrate the feature in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to this feature.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: I added the Ship Management feature of the game.
** What it does: The Ship Management feature consists of three commands (`put`, `list` and `listTags`) and the classes representing the battleship, coordinates, orientation and player fleet.
*** The `put` command allows the user to place a ship on the map grid. The user is also given the option of tagging the ships. The ship can be a `cruiser` of length 2, a `cruiser` of length 3, or an `aircraft carrier` of length 5.
*** The `list` command allows the user to list down the ships that have been placed on the map grid. The user can filter the list by the `name` of the ship or by specific `tags`.
*** The `listTags` command allows the user to list down all the tags that have been used on ships.
** Justification: The Ship Manager feature is crucial to the game as it works together with the map grid to allow both the human player and the computer player to interact in a turn-taking game. Behind the scenes, the  feature also implements the `Coordinates`, `Orientation` and `Fleet` classes for other features to work. Furthermore, the feature implements boundary value checking that is used by the Battle Manager and Computerised Enemy feature.
** Highlights: The other features rely on the functionality provided by the Ship Management feature, such as creating an enemy player and processing the statistics for the game.

// ** Highlights:
// *** Implements coordinates and orientation: Behind the scenes, the feature // implements the `Coordinates`, `Orientation` and `Fleet` classes that are used by // the Battle Manager feature and the Computer Enemy feature.
// *** Implements boundary-value checking of the map grid: The feature // implements code for checking the boundaries of the map grid for a given ship, // which is used by the Battle Manager feature and the Computer Enemy feature // to implement turn-taking in the game.

*__What are the head coordinates?__*

The head coordinates are the coordinates of the top-most and left-most cell of a ship. When coordinates are specified in the `put` command, they refer to the head coordinates of the ship.
