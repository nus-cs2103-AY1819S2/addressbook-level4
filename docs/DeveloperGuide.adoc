By: `CS2103-W16-1`      Since: `Feb 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the UniLA data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the UniLA data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::import[]
=== Import Contacts
==== Current Implementation
The ImportCommand uses `JsonAddressBookStorage` to create a temporary `AddressBook` instance from a given path. It takes in a Path `path` as argument. The command will add the contacts, events and reminders found in this temporary AddressBook but not present in the AddressBook storage into storage. The constructor for ImportCommand is as follows:

[source,java]
 public ImportCommand(Path importPath) {
        requireNonNull(importPath);
        this.filePath = importPath;
        addressBookStorage = new JsonAddressBookStorage(filePath);
 }

The execution flow of ImportCommand is shown in the diagram below.

image::ImportSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]
    Figure: Import command flow chart

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation Import Command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users import contacts, events and reminders from one .json file.
** Pros: This approach minimizes the effort needed from users to import data.
** Cons: Users might want to separate contacts, events and reminders so that importing one component will not affect the other
* **Alternative 2:** Users import contacts, events and reminders from separate files.
** Pros: Data can be imported independently.
** Cons: It takes unnecessary extra effort to import data separately.
// end::import[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export
==== Current Implementation

The `ExportCommand` uses `JsonAddressBookStorage` class to generate a .json file storing contacts, events and reminders by specified tags to store at a specified path. It takes in a String `name`, Path `path` and an optional Tag `tag`. Omitting the tag will simply save all data into the json file. Below is the main idea ExportCommand constructor:

[source,java]
----
public ExportCommand(String fileName, Path exportPath, Tag tagExport) {
        requireNonNull(exportPath);
        this.filePath = exportPath;
        this.fileName = fileName;
        this.tag = tagExport;
        this.addressBookExported = new AddressBook();
        addressBookStorage = new JsonAddressBookStorage(filePath);
    }
----

The execution flow of the Export command is shown below.

image::ExportSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]
    Figure: Export command flow chart


Either zero or one tag can be specified. Therefore below are the possible scenarios:

* Without a tag
** The app exports all contacts, events and reminders in the UniLA by default.
* With a Tag
** The app exports all contacts bearing the specified tag in their tagset, along with all events and reminders.

The final step is to create the xml/excel file from the `teachConnectBook`. This is done with the help of the method `tryStorage()`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation Export Command
* **Alternative 1:** Users can export contacts, events, reminders into separate files.
** Pros: This implementation removes the dependency between contacts, events and reminders. Users can change one component without affecting the other.
** Cons: It might take more effort from users to import and export data in general because they need to handle each component separately.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Users export all data into the same file.
** Pros: This implementation helps remove the need for importing contacts, events and reminders separately. Instead everything can be imported at once.
** Cons: Contacts, events and reminders are exported together, and thus there is codependency between these components.
// end::export[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the UniLA. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::findCommand-yinya998[]

=== Find feature
==== Current Implementation

The mechanism is facilitated by `findCommand`, `findCommandParser` and different Predicate classes. It allows users to search with 3 different search patterns. During the execution of find command, 3 search patterns will be executed one by one.

Given below is the process of executing find command:

Step 1. The exact search: This is a base method of matching string. It's implemented by String.equals().

Step 2. The fuzzy search: This is based on similarity comparison. First edit distance between input keywords and the string in people's fields is calculated based on Levenshtein Distance algorithm. Subsequently, similarity is calculated by s = 1 - Levenshtein_Distance/Max_Length_Of_Two_Strings. The similarity threshold is set to 0.7. If a person’s fields contain keyword which have more than 0.7 similarity to the input keywords, he or she will be returned in fuzzy search result.

Step 3. The wildcard search: This is based on regular expression. It recognizes character *. The character * matches any number of alphanumeric characters consisting of 0-9, a-z and A-Z.

* The following code snippet is from `TagsContainsKeywordPredicate` class. It shows an example of how predicate class works:

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public boolean test(Person person) {
        return keywords.stream()
                .anyMatch(keyword -> {
                    String name = person.getName().fullName;
                    String tags = person.getTagsAsStringNoBracket();
                    if (StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(tags, keyword)) {
                        if (!exactSearchList.contains(name)) {
                            exactSearchList.add(name);
                        }
                        return true;
                    }
                    if (StringUtil.matchFuzzySearch(tags, keyword)) {
                        if (!fuzzySearchList.contains(name)) {
                            fuzzySearchList.add(name);
                       }
                        return true;
                    }
                    if (StringUtil.matchWildcardSearch(tags, keyword)) {
                        if (!wildcardSearchList.contains(name)) {
                            wildcardSearchList.add(name);
                        }
                        return true;
                    }
                    return false;
                });
    }

----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How fuzzy search is executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use similarity to compare the keywords
** Pros: The accuracy is higher because the differences and the total length of the strings are proportional.
** Cons: Less easy to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Use edit distance to compare the keywords
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Lower accuracy especially when the string is short.

[NOTE]
Different search patterns optimize the 'find' command for different kinds of users. They help with users when they cannot remember the exact spelling or users who are prone to typos.


// end::findCommand-yinya998[]


// tag::photoCommand-yinya998[]

=== Photo feature
==== Current Implementation

The mechanism is facilitated by `Photo`, `PhotoCommand` class. A `Photo` class is added to `Model`. It allows users to add a photo to the person in the contact list.

Given below is the process of executing photo command:

Step 1. The command will be checked whether it contains sub command `clear`. If it is a photo clear command, the photo of the contact list will reset to default photo. The photo command execution is finished. Else, following steps will be executed.

Step 2. The input file path will be checked for whether the file exists.

Step 3. The input file path will be checked for whether it can be opened as an image.

Step 4. The size the of photo will be checked for whether it is within the range (smaller than 20MB).

Step 5. The photo will be copied to the program and it is saved to the target person.


* The following code snippet is from PhotoCommand class. It shows an example of how photo command executes:

[source,java]
----
if (photo.getPath().equals(COMMAND_SUB)) {
    photo.setPath(DEFAULT_PHOTOPATH);
    Person personToEdit = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
    String path = personToEdit.getPhoto().getPath();
    File file = new File(path);
    file.delete();

    } else {
    if (!isValidPhotoPath(photo.getPath())) {
         return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_INVALID_PHOTOPATH);
    }
    if (!isImage(photo.getPath())) {
         return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FILE_NOT_IMAGE);
    }
    if (!isPhotoSizeWithinRange(photo.getPath())) {
         return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SIZE_EXCEED);
    }

    String user = System.getProperty("user.name");
    String dir = "data/";
    String copyPath = FileUtil.copyFile(photo.getPath(), String.format(dir, user));
    photo.setPath(copyPath);
    }

----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How photo is stored in UniLA

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Copy the photo to the program.
** Pros: The address book will not be affected if the photo in the original path is moved, renamed or deleted. Stability of the program is ensured.
** Cons: Consumes more memory because the photo is copied to the program.
* **Alternative 2:** Save the path and load the photo from the path every time when user opens the app.
** Pros: Use less memory. Easy to implement.
** Cons: The photo will be not be displayed if the photo in the original path is moved, renamed or deleted.

// end::photoCommand-yinya998[]

// tag::eventlistcomponent-jwl1997[]
=== Event list component
==== Current Implementation

The Event list component complements Person list(the original addressbook4) to provide user with better manage events and their participants. To achieve this, a new Event model is created to according to the below class diagram.

image::EventClassDiagram.png[width="300"]

All the Events object will be stored inside `UniqueEventList`, which becomes another data collection inside `AddressBook` class. When `ModelManager` create `VersionedAddressBook`(implements `AddressBook`), there will be two data collections, one for event and the other for contact.
From the below Model class diagram, it will be easier to see the illustrate how this Event model integrate the original data structures

image::BeforeAfterClassDiagram.png[width="800]

Several use cases are implemented for this event components, the use case diagram is shown below:

image::EventListUseCases.png[width="500"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement Event list component

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add `UniqueEventList` into `AddressBook`.
** Pros: Easy to implement and current redo, undo, clear command can work for this Event model commands
** Cons: `AddressBook` need to manage both contacts and events, thus have to implement more functions, like add, delete, set for both event and person.
* **Alternative 2:** Build another class outside `AddressBook` to maintain `UniqueEventList`
** Pros: Functionality will be separated to different classes.
** Cons: This will need much more implementation to build the event list component, including `VersionedAddressBook`, `redo`,`undo`

// end::eventlistcomponent-jwl1997[]

// tag::contacteventconnection-jwl1997[]
=== Connect feature
==== Current Implementation
The connect feature will provide two commands, `Connect` and `Disconnect`, which is used to add/remove a person to an event as participants.
The connect/disconnect mechanism is facilitated by the `persons` list attribute defined in `Event` class. All the participants for an event is stored inside the `persons` list.
The connect/disconnect functions are achieved by adding/removing person from the list in a specific event.
To achieve this function and other person-event related functions, a unidirectional reference is maintained from `Event` to `Person`, as shown below.

image::EventContactReference.png[width="700"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to implement Connection between contact and event

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain unidirectional relationship between events and contacts.
** Pros: Easier to implement, sufficient for all the operations provided in the current product and less memory/storage required
** Cons: `meet` function need to loop through all events to plan a meeting
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain bidirectional relationship between events and contacts.
** Pros: Still easy to implement, easier to get the events that each person has.
** Cons: This bidirectional relationship is relatively harder to manage than unidirectional, because delete person/event and connect/disconnect need to change both two referencing lists. Also, more storage will be used in this implementation because Person class also maintain all the Events it is participating, although when the number of events and persons is small, the difference in storage is not significant.


// end::contacteventconnection-jwl1997[]

// tag::meet[]
=== Meeting Planner

The mechanism is supported by the MeetCommand class. This command allows users to automatically create a meeting event among certain people, removing the need to siphon through all the events just to find a common available timeslot among contacts to meet. The command will:

****
* search for the earliest available timeslot among the requested people to meet
* create the meeting event in the event list
* connect the requested people to the event and
* set the details of the event (such as name, description etc.) as requested.
****

Format:
`meet INDEX TAGS n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION v/VENUE l/LABEL duration/DURATION s/STARTDATETIME e/ENDDATETIME block/BLOCK`

Example:

`meet 1 2 t/friends t/colleagues n/Snooker competition d/Playing snooker again v/SAFRA Toa Payoh l/snooker duration/0 8 -30 0 s/2019-05-01 00:00:00 e/2019-05-07 00:00:00 block/09:00 18:00`

creates an event whereby:

****
* The event will have the first and second people in the contact list, and all persons with the `friends` or `colleagues` tag, or both
* The event's name is `Snooker competition`
* The event's description is `Playing snooker again`
* The event venue is `SAFRA Toa Payoh`
* The event is labeled as `snooker`
* The event will last 7 hours and 30 minutes
* The event will start at or after 1st May 2019 at 12am
* The event will end at or before 7th May 2019 at 12am
* The event must fall within 9am to 6pm of the same day.
****

==== How it works:
. `MeetCommandParser` parses `meet` command. The `MeetCommandParser` will ensure that:
** at least one index or tag was entered
** all indices are valid
** all other errors caused by invalid arguments will be thrown by `ParserUtil` and `ParserUtilForEvent`
. All the fields are passed as arguments into the constructor of `MeetCommand`, which stores all arguments as instance fields.
. `MeetCommand` retrieves the specified persons from `model`. If a person is not able to be retrieved from the contact list, or if it discovers that less than two valid persons were entered, a `CommandException` is thrown.
. Next, a check will be done to ensure that the specified start time entered is non-trivial, that is, the earliest event created must start at least from the next hour from the time the user enters the command. If the user enters a date and time before the date and time when the command is entered, the next hour after the current date and time will be used instead.
. The full event list will be retrieved from `model`, and piped into a `Stream`.
. Events will be filtered off from the `Stream`, based on whether the event involves any of the people specified by the user. This is so that a common free slot can be found.
. The events will then be sorted in order of start time, so that the earliest available common free time slot can be found.
. The earliest common time slot that fits the given block and duration of the event is searched for.
. This event is created, added, and the addressbook is then committed.

The sequence of interactions is shown in the following diagram:

image::MeetCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The loop portion is not actually implemented with a `for` or `while` loop. Instead, a `Stream` was used as it was able to `filter` and `reduce` each event sequentially.

The following describes the logic behind points 4 till 9.

Suppose the user enters `meet 1 2 3 s/2019-05-14 03:00 duration/0 4 0 0 block/09:30 18:00`. In this case, the indices, tags, name, description, venue and label are trivial to the logic. Further suppose the user enters this command at some date and time before 03:00 on 14 May 2019.

In this user's current events list, there are six events, all involving either persons 1, 2 or 3. These events are "in the way". They are depicted as red boxes in the following diagrams. All other events in the list have been filtered away by the `Stream`.

The yellow region signifies the block entered by the user, i.e. the block of time which the event *must* fall in.

image::MeetCommandLogic1.png[width="800"]

Because the start time is after the next hour from the time the command was entered, an event with a duration of 4 hours that starts on 3am on 14 May 2019 is created. This is labeled as `meeting` in light blue below.

image::MeetCommandLogic2.png[width="800"]

`meeting` is first transformed to fit in the first block. This is done by the `transformEventToFitBlock(Event e)` method.

At this point, all existing events in the events list (shown in red) will be piped into a `Stream` object. This `stream` is filtered, such that all events that do not have *any* of the proposed meeting participants are filtered out.

In this case, because all events in the user's events list involve either persons 1, 2 or 3, none of them are filtered out. Now, `reduce` is applied on this `Stream` object.

The following is the code snippet for the `reduce` method.

[source,java]
----
.reduce(meeting, (x, y) -> {
    LocalDateTime xEnd = toDateTime(x.getEndDateTime());
    LocalDateTime yStart = toDateTime(y.getStartDateTime());
    LocalDateTime yEnd = toDateTime(y.getEndDateTime());
    if (toDateTime(x.getStartDateTime()).isAfter(yEnd)
            || !xEnd.isAfter(yStart)) {
        return x;

    }
    LocalDateTime start = yEnd;
    return transformEventToFitBlock(new Event(name, description, venue,
            new DateTime(start.format(DateTime.DATE_TIME_FORMATTER)),
            new DateTime(start.plus(duration).format(DateTime.DATE_TIME_FORMATTER)), label));
});
----

In this case, `x` will always be the `meeting` event, shown in blue. Event `y` will be highlighted green.

Because the `stream` has already been sorted in order of start `DateTime` s, `y` will be selected in order of left to right in the diagram.

The logic behind `reduce` is as follows:

* If `x` does not clash with `y`, then `(x, y)` reduces to `x`.
* Else, create a new meeting that starts at the end `DateTime` of y, then transform it to fit the block.

Pictorially, it will look like the following.

image::MeetCommandLogic3.png[width="800"]

The left-most event is selected as `y`. In the first use of `reduce`, the `identity` was set to be the initial `meeting:Event`, in blue.

Because the event in blue does not clash with the event in green, both events simply reduce to the one in blue. The next left-most event is selected as the next `y`.

image::MeetCommandLogic4.png[width="800"]

In this case, the event in blue clashes with the event in green. Thus, a new event, with a duration of 4 hours (same as before), that starts at the end of `y`, is created. This event is then transformed to fit the block, which in this case already does. The old blue and green events are reduced to this new event.

image::MeetCommandLogic5.png[width="800"]

Here, the event in blue clashes with the event in green. A new event with a duration of 4 hours, that starts at the end of `y`, is created. This event is then transformed to fit the block, in this case, it is pushed all the way to start at 09:30 the next day.

image::MeetCommandLogic6.png[width="800"]

image::MeetCommandLogic6a.png[width="800"]

The event here does not clash with `meeting`. Both events reduce to `meeting`.

image::MeetCommandLogic7.png[width="800"]

Here, the event in blue clashes with the event in green. Just as before, the two old events are reduced to a new meeting event that starts right after the end of `y` and is within the block.

image::MeetCommandLogic8.png[width="800"]

Finally, the last event does not clash with the event in blue. Both events reduce to the event in blue.

image::MeetCommandLogic9.png[width="800"]

This event is then tested whether its end `DateTime` is later than the latest end `DateTime` specified by the user, and whether there are duplicate events. I would have written a lot more, but I'm out of space in my PPP.

=== Reminder Component

The mechanism is supported by the `reminder` and `reminderList` class. It allows users to add reminders to event, which will pop in app certain interval before event start time. Please refer to this class diagram.

image::ReminderEventRelationship.png[width="800"]

`reminderList` will keep track of all `reminder`.
`reminder` class contains `Unit`, `Interval` to facilitate the constructor building. Please refer to the following class diagram.

image::ReminderClassDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Aspect: How to implement `reminder`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create new model, named `reminder` to include `reminder` and `reminderList` class.
** Pros: Convenient for modifying because of the relatively loose connection with `event`.
** Cons: Require large change in model.
* **Alternative 2:** Add another attribute named reminder to record the remind time and we can list the event by sorting remind time.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Only need `event` and `person` model.
** Cons: Not easy to delete corresponding reminder after its reminding time as it is highly connected with event. Cannot be applied and modified anywhere.

==== Aspect: How to implement `reminderList`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create only one reminder list for whole `UniLA`.
** Pros: Convenient for adding, deleting, and checking.
** Cons: Required more connection between logic and model.
* **Alternative 2:** Create one reminder list for each event for whole `UniLA`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Not centered. Need to loop through every event when add, delete and check.


// end::reminderComponent-jillWangJill[]
// tag::reminderFeature-jillWangJill[]
=== Reminder Feature

Please take a look at use case diagram first.

image::ReminderUseCase.png[width="400"]

Among these features, the `addR` combined with `reminderCheck` is the most useful one. The mechanism is supported by `ReminderCheck`,`AddR` and `AddR parser` classes. It allows users to create a reminder in certain interval before event start time.
And the reminder will pop inside app at that reminding time. Also, it will disappear after showing up for one minute.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `AddR` reminder behaves.

Step 1. The user lists events in address and select the event that the user wants UniLA to remind.

Step 2. User run command `addR 2 t/4 u/min`, which will let UniLA add the one 4min-before-starttime reminder to the second event.

Step 3. When the time is up, the reminder pop up under `listR` model.

Step 4. After showing up for 1 minute, the reminder will be automatically deleted from the reminder list.

==== How it works:
* AddRCommandParser parses `addR` command. The AddRCommandParser will ensure the interval unit and to check possible exceptions.
* Interval and event will be passed to AddRCommand. AddRCommand touched model to create new reminder in reminder list.
* Another thread named `reminderCheck` will be running at the same time. It will check when to pop up the reminder, and when to make it disappear by comparing `the starting time - interval` with `current time`.
* Reminder which satisfies the time requirement will pop up under `listR` model.
* Reminder will be deleted from reminder list after it shows up for 1 minute.

To achieve the reminder check function, another thread is created as the sequence diagram shown below.

image::reminderListSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


// end::reminderFeature-jillWangJill[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the UniLA, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the UniLA.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your UniLA application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the UniLA is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the UniLA to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the UniLA after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the UniLA storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the UniLA can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAddressBookStorage.java[`JsonAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
