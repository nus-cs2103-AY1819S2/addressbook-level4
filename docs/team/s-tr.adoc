== Project: Battleship CLI

Battleship CLI is an implementation of the classic game Battleship.

As part of a group project in the module https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-website/index.html[CS2103] in NUS,
my group had to morph an existing product, https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[`addressbook-level4`],
into a new product while keeping the original product's distinctive feature of being operated through the command-line.
My group chose to morph it into a command-line based Battleships application.

My role in the team was to design and implement the `Battle` feature, which:

  * Ensures that the human and computer players each take their turns in order,
  * Ensures that the game progresses in a fixed sequence of stages (from setting up the map, to placing ships, to attacking)

The following sections illustrate the feature in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to this feature.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented *the logic for the battle stage of the game* +
  The battle is one of the two important phases of Battleship, along with the placing of ships.
  Via the battle feature, the user will be able to launch attacks at the enemy, and the enemy launch
  attacks at the user. Crucially, it ensures that the user and enemy take their turns in the correct
  order.
* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to prevent commands from being executed at inappropriate times* +
  Preventing the user from executing certain commands at certain times (e.g. the user should not
  be placing ships when the battle is already in progress) will ensure the correct progression of
  the game, as well as prevent the game from entering an invalid state.
