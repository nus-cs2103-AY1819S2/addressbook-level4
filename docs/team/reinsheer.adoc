== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: intending to add major statistic command by v1.4
** What it does: gives basic statistics to user for visualisation purposes, for example he knows his top worn apparel
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can have greater clarity for his wardrobe and allows the user to be more aware of his usage patterns
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: nil

* *Code contributed*: refactoring and test cases


* *Other contributions*:
** Refactored entire AddressBook to become Fashion Match
** Fix test cases that resulted from the refactoring of AddressBook
** Managed release of `v1.3`, reviewed and merged all PRs from week 10 saturday onwards on GitHub
** Cleanup of the Developer Guide from AddressBook4 to Fashion Match: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W15-1/main/pull/8
