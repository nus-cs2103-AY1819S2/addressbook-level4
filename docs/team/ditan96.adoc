== About the project

Welcome to my Project Portfolio Page! My team and I were tasked to enhance an open source, basic command line interface (CLI) addressbook for our Software engineering project.
Given the constraints that the final product had to use CLI as the primary mode of input and be functional offline,
we decided to morph it into a project management application called Pocket Project.

This upgraded application enables project managers to keep track of everything about ongoing and completed projects, as well as the data of employees under the manager, all in one place.

My role was to design and write the code for the `addto projecttask`, `update projecttask` and `removefrom projecttask` features. The following sections will explain in more detail these features,
as well as my documentation contributions in the user and developer guides during this project.

Before we continue, do take note of the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

|===
|Symbol |Meaning

|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]
|The note pad icon indicates any information which you might find handy.

|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]
|The light bulb icon indicates any shortcuts
that you can use while using application.

|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]
|The exclamation mark icon indicates any warnings that you might want to take note of when using Pocket Project.

|```addto```| A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command you can use in Pocket Project. In the documentation sections, this might refer to code-related implementations in the application.

|```[aqua]#addto#```| A grey highlight with light blue text indicates this is an abbreviated command shortened for the sake of brevity.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows you a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

*Major feature added*: Project tasks which helps users to track a project's progress.

.*How the milestones and tasks feature looks like*

** What it does: The `[aqua]#addto projecttask#` command adds a task to a milestone in a project. The `[aqua]#update projecttask#` command allows the manager to set the status of the task to ongoing, on hold or complete.
   The `[aqua]#removefrom projecttask#` command removes the specified task completely from the milestone.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it greatly enhances the level of organization and control which the manager has while planning out a schedule for projects.
** Highlights: The implementation of this feature was slightly unique and required an approach different from how other features were implemented as a project task is a component of milestones which is in a project.
   Most other features in Pocket Project directly interact with either employees or projects, unlike that of project tasks which interact only with milestones. It required me to make changes to the behaviour of the
   existing Milestone class and how it was stored in a project in order to get it to work as desired.
** Credits: The code for `addto` command parser which I extended for the project task feature and the original milestone code which I enhanced was done by my teammate Jothinandan Pillay.
   The code for `update` command parser was done by my teammate Jeff Gan. The code for `removefrom` command parser was done by my teammate Lin Dehui.
