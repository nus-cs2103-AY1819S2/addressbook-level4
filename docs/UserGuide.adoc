== Introduction

*TravelBuddy* is a desktop journal app for all your travel memories! Add all the places you've been,
attach photos (coming in Version 2.0), keep a diary, create custom tags and tag different places, and search through all of your places!

It's 2019, and we understand your desire for transparency, so *TravelBuddy* will also
provide clear data visualisation and analytics in upcoming versions. *TravelBuddy* also solemnly pledges to not
collect or sell your data in any shape or form.

*TravelBuddy* is also optimized for those who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
