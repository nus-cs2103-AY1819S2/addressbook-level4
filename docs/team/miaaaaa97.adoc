== PROJECT: BookSquirrel

---

== Overview

BookSquirrel(v1.4) is for those who want to keep a record of books theyâ€™ve read. More importantly, BookSquirrel is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, BookSquirrel can get your note management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Review feature*.
** What it does: allows the user to add, list, view, and delete reviews.
** Justification: This feature enables the user to record their thoughts when they read books.
** Highlights: This feature requires a lot of change to the UI and model of the application, meanwhile, it is closely linked to the book feature, which
makes it challenging and bug-prone. To find a way to store reviews, many architectures were considered.
Extra care was taken to integrate Reviews with existing Book commands, such as to cascade any deletion or editing of books.

* *Minor enhancement*: fixed the bug that ConfigUtil will always output config.json with missing new line at end of file, which causes the travis build to fail unless a new line is manually added.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=miaaaaa97[Functional code]]
