* _Acquizition_ is a desktop flashcard application for subject revision and language acquisition.
* Using a scientifically-grounded SRS (Spaced Repetition System), _Acquizition_ maximizes
memory retention by testing the terms most likely to be forgotten soon.
* _Acquizition_ has a sleek and intuitive GUI (Graphical User Interface) to streamline the experience
for new users, but also sports a CLI (Command Line Interface) to maximize the efficiency of
power users. It's the best of both worlds!
