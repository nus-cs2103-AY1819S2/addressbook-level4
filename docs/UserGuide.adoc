== Introduction

MINDEF Duty Planner is a platform to assist military units in the SAF in the assignment of daily guard duties amongst the servicemen. +
The application is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
The software is designed to automate the process of fairly assigning duties to available servicemen for an entire month. +
The application can be used by both Commanders and servicemen to plan and view duties with various specific commands for each type of user. +
To start using MINDEF Duty Planner you can go to <<Quick Start>> +
To see a summary list of commands you can go to <<Command Summary>>

== Notation

* Words that are highlighted with a grey background
represent a  `command` that is present or used in the
application.

* Words that are highlighted in white represent a kbd:[keyboard] button that
can be pressed to invoke a described function.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Log in into the system as an admin or a general user. NRIC corresponds to the username. Both the NRIC and the password are case-sensitive.

* For master admin account: username is Admin, password is Admin
* For other admin or general account: username is the user's NRIC, password is NRIC by default which can be changed.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all personnel
* **`add`**`n/John Doe nr/S9012345N p/98765432 c/Echo s/2 r/CFC t/injured`  : adds a personnel named `John Doe` to the Personnel Database.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
.  Some commands can only be accessed by Admin type accounts and some by General type accounts.

== User Features

// tag::login[]
=== Log in
****
* For Practical Exam: You may use an administrator account with Username: Admin, and Password: Admin
* If you close the login window, you are still able to view the personnel list and the calendar duty list. However, you will not be able to use any commands. You may simply close the window to exit the program.

****

==== Logging into a User account +
NRIC and passwords are case-sensitive. +
Enter in NRIC and password into the top and bottom text areas respectively, press enter. +
****
* Can only be done in the login box at the start of the program.
* By default, if your password has not been changed by you or an Admin, the password is your NRIC.
* Contact an administrator if you have trouble logging in.
* If you need to change your account, exit the program, then log back into a different account.
* There are 2 types of accounts: General type accounts, and Admin (or Administrator) type accounts.
* Admin accounts have access to more commands, or more functionalities for some kind of commands.
The commands for each type of account are listed in <<Features for all users>>,<<General User Features>> and <<Admin Features>>
****
// end::login[]

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `edit 1 nr/NRIC`, `NRIC` is a parameter which can be used as `edit 1 nr/S01234567Z`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* An Admin and a User may have different formats for the same command

==== View duty points : `points`
Displays the duty points accumulated by each person. Additional records of each person (i.e. duties allocated, points rewarded, points penalized) can also be viewed.

Format:  `points [INDEX]`

[NOTE]
Calling the command without index (`points`) provides a list of all persons and their accumulated duty points while calling the command with index (`points INDEX`) provides the accumulated duty points of an individual person and his record (i.e. duties, points rewarded, points penalized).

Examples:

* `points 2` +
Retrieves the duty points of the 2nd person on the contact list, as well as his records with information such as duties allocated, points rewards and points penalized.
* `points` +
Displays a list of all persons and their respective duty points.
// end::pointsAdmin[]


// tag::rewardAdmin[]
==== Reward points : `reward`
Manually reward duty points to a person or a list of persons.

Format: `reward i/INDEX [INDEX] [INDEX] ... p/POINTS`

* Points rewarded can range from 1 to 100 for each command call.

Examples:

* `reward i/1 2 4 5 p/20` +
Rewards 20 points each to the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th person on the contact list.
* `reward i/3 p/4` +
Rewards 4 points to the 3th person on the contact list.
// end::rewardAdmin[]

// tag::penalizeAdmin[]
==== Penalize points : `penalize`
Manually penalize duty points for a person or a list of persons.

Format: `penalize i/INDEX [INDEX] [INDEX] ... p/POINTS`

* Points penalized can range from 1 to 100 for each command call.
* The duty points of a person can fall to less than zero.

Examples:

* `penalize i/1 2 4 5 p/20` +
Penalize 20 points each for the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th person on the contact list.
* `penalize i/3 p/4` +
Penalize 4 points for the 3th person on the contact list.
// end::penalizeAdmin[]

// tag::settingsAdmin[]
==== View and edit duty settings (points and manpower needed for each day of the week) : `settings`
View and edit duty settings. Duty settings refer to the *manpower needed* and *points rewarded* for each duty based on the day of the week (e.g. Sunday, Monday, etc)

Format: `settings [d/DAYOFWEEK m/MANPOWER p/POINTS]`

* `DAYOFWEEK`: Mon / Tue / Wed / Thur / Fri / Sat / Sun (full spelling e.g. Monday, Tuesday etc. works as well) +
* `MANPOWER`: Number ranging from 1 to 10 +
* `POINTS`: Number ranging from 1 to 100

[NOTE]
Calling the command `settings` alone displays the current duty settings while calling the command `settings` with the day of the week, manpower and points enables the editing of the duty settings.

[NOTE]
The updated duty settings will only take effect the next time a schedule is confirmed. If schedule for next month has already been confirmed, the confirmed schedule will still follow the specifications of the previous duty settings.

Examples:

* `settings` +
Displays the duty settings - for each day of the week, the manpower needed and points to be rewarded.
* `settings d/sun m/3 p/4` +
Duty settings edited. Sunday duties now require 3 persons and 4 points will be rewarded to each person assigned a Sunday duty.
* `settings d/monday m/2 p/3` +
Duty settings edited. Monday duties now require 2 persons and 3 points will be rewarded to each person assigned a Monday duty.
// end::settingsAdmin[]

// tag::scheduleAdmin[]
==== Schedule duties : `schedule`
Creates a viable duty schedule for the upcoming month. The scheduling algorithm takes into account the manpower needs of each duty day, blocked dates of each person, the current duty points of each person and points rewarded for each duty to generate a fair schedule.

Format: `schedule`

The algorithm is optimized such that a person with low duty points will be allocated to duties which rewards high points and possibly be given more duties. It automatically attempts to balance out the points of each person after scheduling.

[NOTE]
The command `schedule` merely provides a viable duty schedule and *does not confirm the schedule* to the calendar. Duty points have also yet been updated. The schedule generated is not deterministic and calling `schedule` again will regenerate a new duty schedule.

Once a satisfactory duty schedule is generated, the administrator can go ahead to confirm the duty schedule. (See 4.4.10 Confirm a schedule)

Calling `schedule` after next month's duties have already been confirm will only display the confirmed duty schedule.
// end::scheduleAdmin[]

// tag::confirmAdmin1[]
==== Confirm a schedule : `confirm`
Confirms the duty schedule that was previously generated (from the `schedule` command) for the upcoming month.

Format: `confirm`
// end::confirmAdmin1[]

// tag::confirmAdmin2[]

A confirmed duty schedule can be viewed on the calendar (using the `viewNext` command). Duty points will be updated accordingly to reward those who were assigned duties.
// end::confirmAdmin2[]

// tag::replace[]
==== Manually replace a person in the duty : `replace` `coming in v2.0`
Replaces the particular person assigned to the duty with the given person.

Format : `replace d/DUTYDATE(DDMMYY) o/NRIC n/NRIC`

If the person the user is trying to replace with is already assigned to that particular duty, the system will throw an exception.
Both the person getting replaced and the person replacing have to be present in the database.

Example:

* `replace d/140219 o/S9012345L n/G9043214N` +
Replaces the person with NRIC S9012345L in duty on 14th Feb 2019 with the person with NRIC G9043214N.
// end::replace[]

// tag::adminswap[]
==== View Swaps Command : `viewSwaps`
Used to view all the swap requests that have a requester-accepter pair. The list will be shown in the results display. The Admin User can then accept or reject the swap using the AcceptSwap or RejectSwap command.

Format : `viewSwaps`

==== Approve Swap Command : `approveSwap`
The Admin User can use this command to approve a certain swap at the given index in the list of paired swap requests in the results display after a viewSwaps command. This will edit the duties in the schedule as well as the points for each user. Thereafter, the request will be deleted.

Format : `approveSwap INDEX`

****
* A non-positive index or an index which exceeds the list size will result in an error message.
* At the start of a new month, all existing swaps, open or paired, will be deleted.
* The users involved in the swap request must refrain from making or accepting two swaps for a duty on the same day. The code to restrict this behaviour will be implemented in v2.0.
* The approve swap request will still work even if the list is not showing at the results display. The index will refer to the request that would be in the list if the list were displayed (The order of the list does not change)
****

Example: 'approveSwap 1' +

==== Reject Swap Command : `rejectSwap`
The Admin User can use this command to reject a certain swap at the given index in the list of paired swap requests in the results display after a viewSwaps command. Thereafter, the request will be deleted.

Format : `rejectSwap INDEX`

****
* A non-positive index or an index which exceeds the list size will result in an error message.
* At the start of a new month, all existing swaps, open or paired, will be deleted.
* The users involved in the swap request must refrain from making or accepting two swaps for a duty on the same day. The code to restrict this behaviour will be implemented in v2.0.
* The reject swap request will still work even if the list is not showing at the results display. The index will refer to the request that would be in the list if the list were displayed (The order of the list does not change)
