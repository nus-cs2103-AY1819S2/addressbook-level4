== Introduction to MediTabs
* *MediTabs* is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing medicine stock taking.
* This is especially useful for clinics such as family clinics or private clinics to track the amount of medicine they have left available.

== Some of the Key Features of MediTabs
* It can check the medicine inventory for medicine which are _low stock_ or _expiring_ and *display warnings* to notify that action is required. The warnings are organised in a warning panel for easier access and are automatically removed when the required actions have been taken. With *MediTabs*, you can be at ease knowing that all medicine stocks are accounted for and are not expired.
* Sorting the medicines is easy using *MediTabs* such as by _quantity_, _expiry date_ or by _name_. Sorting by _ascending_ or _descending_ orders are also possible.

== Benefits of MediTabs
1. It is _optimized_ for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still being able to enjoy the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
2. If you can type fast, MediTabs can get your medicine stock taking done faster than traditional GUI apps.
