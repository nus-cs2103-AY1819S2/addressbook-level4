== PROJECT: The Real App

---

== Overview

*The Real App* is an enhanced desktop address book designed primarily for *real estate agents*. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancement*: Added the ability to *archive/unarchive contacts*
** What it does:
*** Allows the user to archive existing contacts which are deleted from the main working contact list, but kept as storage which can be displayed or even unarchived when needed.
** Justification:
*** This feature improves the product significantly because users who want to remove their contacts can remove them from their main address book without permanently deleting them.
*** They can keep these contacts in a separate archive storage in case of future need, and these archived contacts can be restored back into the main address book when needed.
** Highlights:
*** This enhancement affects almost all existing commands and commands to be added in future. Each command has be to defined whether the main address book list or the archive list should be displayed before the execution of the command and/or would be displayed after.
*** It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
*** The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands, especially the undo/redo commands.
** Credits: Existing ideas of the AddressBook storage in AddressBook-Level4 was used to create the ArchiveBook storage.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Added a Google Maps query in the browser panel that allows the user to view the location of a selected contact's address on Google Maps.
