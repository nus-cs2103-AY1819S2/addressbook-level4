By: `Team T12-2`      Since: `Feb 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteCard.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::design-ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashcardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CardViewPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Listens for changes to the quiz mode status, and updates the UI accordingly.
// end::design-ui[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CardCollectionParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a flashcard).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteFlashcardSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Card Collection data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Card Collection`, which `Flashcard` can reference. This would allow `Card Collection` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Flashcard` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Card Collection data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCardCollection`.
It extends `CardCollection` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `cardCollectionStateList`, `commandHistory` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* VersionedCardCollection#commit(String commandText)` -- Saves the current card collection state in its history, with `commandText` be the command that change the state.
* `VersionedCardCollection#undo()` -- Restores the previous card collection state from its history and return the string represent the command that is undone.
* `VersionedCardCollection#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone card collection state from its history and return the string represent the command that is redid.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCardCollection()`, `Model#undoCardCollection()` and `Model#redoCardCollection()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCardCollection` will be initialized with the initial card collection state, the initial command history, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single card collection state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th flashcard in the card collection. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCardCollection()`, causing the modified state of the card collection after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `cardCollectionStateList`, String `delete` is added to the `commandHistory` and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted card collection state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add f/Hello ...` to add a new flashcard. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCardCollection()`, causing another modified card collection state to be saved into the `cardCollectionStateList` and string `add` is added to `commandHistory`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCardCollection()`, so the card collection state will not be saved into the `cardCollectionStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the flashcard was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCardCollection()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous card collection state, and restores the card collection to that state. Then, `Model#undoCardCollection()` returns the command that is undone.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial card collection state, then there are no previous card collection states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCardCollection()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCardCollection()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, restores the card collection to that state, and returns the redid command from command history.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `cardCollectionStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest card collection state, then there are no undone card collection states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCardCollection()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the card collection, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCardCollection()`, `Model#undoCardCollection()` or `Model#redoCardCollection()`. Thus, the `cardCollectionStateList` and `commandHistory` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCardCollection()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `cardCollectionStateList`, all card collection states and all command histories after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add f/Hello ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire card collection.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the flashcard being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of card collection states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedCardCollection`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::quiz[]
=== Quiz feature
==== Current Implementation
===== Quiz

The current quiz mechanism is controlled by the `QuizCommand` class.
When executed, `QuizCommand` will create a list of flashcards to be quizzed,
which is a sorted list of the current filtered flashcards. `QuizCommand` will then pass the sorted flashcards to `Model`,
in which they will be stored.

* When quiz first starts, `QuizCommand` will change the quiz state inside `Model`.
* `MainWindow` will detect this change, and replace the card collection panel on the left with a quiz panel.

* To show a card to the user, the quiz mode modifies the selected flashcard on the card collection model, just like how the `SelectCommand` works. The UI will then detect the change in the selected flashcard and will view the selected flashcard on the card view panel.

* The quiz command will quiz flashcards based on the current filtered list.
* The review mode of quiz sorts the cards based on a non-decreasing success rate of the flashcards, utilizing the `Statistics` class.
* If any two flashcards have the same success rate, they will be randomly shuffled.
* Meanwhile, the SRS mode only chooses flashcards that is already time to show to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the quiz operation works:

image::QuizSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

* As illustrated in the diagram above, `MainWindow` detects the change by listening on the observable quiz state mode inside `Model`.

* The `MainWindow` swaps the card collection list panel with the quiz panel by replacing the left panel placeholder with a new `UiPart` through `MainWindow#setLeftPanel`.

===== Show

The `ShowCommand` is handled similarly with the `QuizCommand`.

* Instead of `MainWindow`, `CardViewPanel` listens to the change in quiz state mode inside `Model`.
* The `CardViewPanel` creates a new `FlashcardCardView` with the correct state (with back face shown).
* Then, the displayed flashcard will be replaced.

Below is the sequence diagram of how the show operation works:

image::ShowSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Good/Bad

The feedback on the quiz from the user is handled by a separate command (`GoodCommand` and `BadCommand`),
which then updates the card's statistics based on how well the user does.

* It does not commit the changes of the flashcards until the quiz mode has ended.
* After storing the changes, the command will then show the next card to be quizzed, if there are any, or execute an `ExitCommand` otherwise.

* After `ExitCommand` is executed, the changes will be committed and saved to storage.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `GoodCommand` works. The `BadCommand` is identical.

image::GoodSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Exit

When exiting inside quiz mode, the `ExitCommand` will try to exit the quiz mode.
Otherwise it will just exit the app normally.

* `ExitCommand` will set the quiz mode to `QuizState#NOT_QUIZ_MODE`.

* `MainWindow` will listen to this and update the left panel back to card collection list panel.
* Since the `GoodCommand` and `BadCommand` does not directly update the flashcards, `ExitCommand` needs to commit the changes.
* It will call `Model#commit()`, and this will set `cardCollectionModified` to true.

* After the command execution is finished, the `LogicManager` will call `Storage#saveCardCollection` to store the changes to file.

Below is the sequence diagram when exiting from a quiz mode:

image::ExitQuizSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: The quiz GUI

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same window as the `MainWindow`.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement and can use the original command box for quiz feedback.
*** Can reuse the card view panel from the main window to use for quiz mode.
** Cons:
*** Need to be able to swap the `MainWindow` 's components when the quiz starts in order to replace the card collection list view with the quiz panel.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a separate window for quiz mode.
** Pros:
*** Quiz logic separate from `MainWindow`.
*** Easily customizable and more flexible.
*** Much easier to handle GUI, since we only need to spawn a new window and close it afterwards.
** Cons:
*** Requires a separate command box for the quiz mode window.
*** May need to be able to hide the main window so that users cannot see the card collection list.

// end::quiz[]

//tag::srs[]
=== Spaced Repetition System (SRS) Feature
SRS is an extension for quiz mode. The idea of SRS is for the app to keep track of when each flashcard can be tested. It allows the user to learn the flashcards effectively by showing more "hard to remember" flashcards more often.
SRS is facilitated by `Proficiency` class. In this section, you will read the API from `Proficiency` class and the current implementation of SRS feature.

==== Proficiency Class API
`Proficiency` is an immutable attribute of `Flashcard` class. It keeps track the time a particular flashcard can be reviewed and the proficiency level to indicate how well user remember the flashcard. It stores two main data:

* `timeUntilReview` -- a `Calendar` object to indicate the time a flashcard can be reviewed.
* `proficiencyLevel`-- a non-negative integer to indicate the proficiency level of the user. Higher proficiency level means the user is more proficient.

Additionally, `Proficiency` implements the following APIs:

* `Proficiency#isIncludedInCurrentQuiz()` -- a method to check whether the current flashcard can be included in the current Quiz with SRS mode.
* `Proficiency#quizAttempt(boolean isSuccess)` -- Returns a new `Proficiency` object that has the updated proficiency level and the next time a flashcard can be reviewed.
* `Proficiency#getQuizSrsStatus()` -- Returns a string indicating when the flashcard can be reviewed.

These operations are exposed in the higher level `Flashcard` API:

 * `Flashcard#isIncludedInCurrentQuiz()`
 * `Flashcard#quizAttempt(boolean isSuccess, boolean isQuizSrs)`
 * `Flashcard#getQuizSrsStatus()`

The way `Proficiency` updates is inspired by the Leitner System. Whenever a user successfully guesses a flashcard, the `proficiencyLevel` of that card is incremented by one and the current flashcard can only be reviewed after `proficiencyLevel` days in the future. For example, if the current flashcard's proficiency level is 3, and the user is successfully guessing this flashcard, the proficiency level will be updated to 4 and the card can only be reviewed after 4 days from now. If a user fails to guess the flashcard, the proficiency level will be dropped to zero and the card can be reviewed immediately.

==== Current Implementation

The notable difference between SRS and the vanilla quiz is how the app chooses the flashcards for the quiz and how the app updates the data of each flashcards.

* when SRS mode is started, `QuizCommand` creates a list of flashcards to be quizzed; it consists of the current filtered flashcards that is filtered based on the card that can be included in the current quiz.

* Next, `QuizCommand` will then pass the filtered list to `Model`, in which they will be stored. It also change the quiz state in the model and tells the model that the current quiz mode is SRS mode.

* After the quiz session is done, `ExitCommand` is executed and it will check whether the quiz mode is SRS mode via `Model#getIsQuizSrs()`. If the mode is SRS, both proficiency and statistics of the flashcards will be updated, otherwise only the statistics of the flashcards are updated.

The following is the sequence diagram illustrating when the quiz srs starts and ends.

image::QuizStartSRSSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::srs[]

// tag::imagesupport[]
=== Image Support
==== Current Implementation

All images must first be _imported_ into _Acquizition_ through the use of the `image` command. This command
makes a copy of an image into _Acquizition_'s local `image/` directory, and works as the following sequence
diagram shows:

image::ImageSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Note that `image` does not go through VersionedCardCollection, as it does not affect any of the flashcards.
It affects only a different file directory made specifically for the purpose of storing images. As a consequence,
`image` is not an undoable command.

Once an image has been imported, it can then be directly referenced in the `add` or `edit` commands by using the
original file name. (For example, if one imported the image `C:\Users\Robin\Desktop\everest.jpg`, then it should be
referred to in the future as `everest.jpg`.) _Acquizition_ will simply check to see whether that image really exists in the `images/`
folder.

Each flashcard has an ImagePath, which is essentially a wrapper for an `Optional<String>`, but for convenience' sake also contains
many file-related functions. This allows us to abstract away details of file handling and properly use SLAP.

Altogether, the following shows the activity diagram for an end-user who wants to add a flashcard, considering all possible
fields that could be added:

image::AddFlashcardActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Image Storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make a copy of the image from the user's directory to _Acquizition_'s working
directory when adding images.
** Pros: Works even when the images in the user's directory are later deleted or moved.
** Cons: Requires more memory and can result in a lot of redundant images, and requires manually ensuring that no naming
conflicts occurs on the working directory.
* **Alternative 2:** Link to the absolute path in the user's directory when adding images.
** Pros: Simpler to implement.
** Cons: Breaks when the images in the user's directory are later deleted or moved.

===== Aspect: Image Storage Version Control

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Simply do not allow undo and redo of inserted images.
** Pros: Simpler to implement.
** Cons: May be slightly unintuitive.
* **Alternative 2:** Make a version-controlled version of the images, similar to VersionedCardCollection,
in order to make undo and redo possible.
** Pros: More intuitive behavior.
** Cons: Very complicated to implement, and may not be worth the effort. In the end, users can always
remove flashcards directly by deleting images from the `images/` folder.

// end::imagesupport[]

// tag::findfeature[]
=== Find Feature
==== Current Implementation
The find command allows users to find and list a specific set of flashcards. It is
implemented under the Logic component which in turn calls upon the Model component to retrieve
the flashcards a user wishes to find.

Users can filter the results based on several attributes of a flashcard including front face text, back face text,
tags and success rate. Similar to the Add command, the input is expected to have predefined prefixes (`f/`, `b/`, `t/`, `s/`)
to specify the filter categories; followed by keywords on which a match is expected.
The implementation as well as class interactions can be further explained with the
following sequence diagram:

image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width="800"]

The `FindCommandParser` class takes the input string specified by the user and tokenizes it based on the prefixes to create
a list of keywords associated with each of prefix. Unlike other prefixes, the `s/` prefix (which specifies the success rate range
which cards should be within), will not take a keyword as input. Instead, the range takes two doubles: lower bound and upper bound.

After being parsed, these keyword lists, as well as the success rate range, are passed to construct a new `FlashcardPredicate` object which is
then used to define the `FindCommand`. The execution of the `FindCommand` calls upon the `Model` object to update the
filtered flashcard list based on the predicate defined. This is done through the use of the test method in the predicate classes
which evaluate matches between the keywords and a specific attribute of the flashcard. A flashcard will be selected if it is within
the success rate range and has matching keyword(s) in at least one of the three categories: front face text, back face text and tags.
The logic of evaluation can be seen from the following code snippet:

----
return ((frontFacePredicate.test(flashcard)
        || backFacePredicate.test(flashcard)
        || tagPredicate.test(flashcard))
        && (flashcard.getStatistics().getSuccessRate() * 100 >= lowerBound
        && flashcard.getStatistics().getSuccessRate() * 100 <= upperBound));
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: The evaluation of keyword matches

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** has matching keyword(s) in at least one of the three categories: front face text,
back face text and tags.
** Pros: Able to show cards in multiple categories when the input has multiple tags. Users will get the set of cards as long as
they correctly remember a keyword in either the front face text, back face text or the tags of flashcards.
** Cons: Cannot narrow down to choose the intersection of all filters.
* **Alternative 2:** has matching keyword(s) in all specified categories.
** Pros: Able to show a very specific set of flashcards
** Cons: May not be able to find the wanted set of flashcards when some keywords are remembered wrongly.

// end::findfeature[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics feature

The statistics command allows the user to filter his / her flashcards and calculate the success rate of the filtered flashcards based on the past attempts in quiz mode. In this section, you will read about `Statistics` class API followed by the current implementation of the `StatsCommand`.

==== Statistics Class

`Statistics` acts as an immutable container to store the data for calculating the success percentages from quiz mode. Each Flashcard object has exactly one `Statistics` attribute. `Statistics` stores two main data:

* `successAttempt` -- the number of success attempt in quiz mode.
* `attemptNumber`  -- the total number of attempt in quiz mode.

Additionally, `Statistics` implements the following APIs:

* `Statistics#getSuccessRate()` -- Return the success rate which is `successAttempt` divided by `attemptNumber`.
* `Statistics#quizAttempt(bool isSuccess)` -- Returns a new statistics object that has the updated statistics based on the attempt from the quiz mode.
* `Statistics#merge(Statistics other)` -- Return merged statistics of two given statistics, generally to be used to calculate the success rate from a bunch of flashcards.

These operations (except the merge operation) are exposed in the higher level `Flashcard` API:

 * `Flashcard#isIncludedInCurrentQuiz()`
 * `Flashcard#quizAttempt(boolean isSuccess, boolean isQuizSrs)`

==== Current Implementation

Stats command is implemented under the `Logic` component which will calls the `Model` component to retrieve the flashcards the user wishes, followed by the calculation of the statistics by aggregating the statistics from the retrieved flashcards.

Users can filter the results based on several attributes of a flashcard including front face text, back face text, tags and success rate. Similar to the Add command, the input is expected to have predefined prefixes (`f/`, `b/`, `t/`, `s/`) to specify the filter categories; followed by keywords on which a match is expected.

The implementation can be further explained with the aid of the following sequence diagram:

image::StatsCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `StatsCommandParser` parses the input arguments in the same manner as `FindCommandParser`. `StatsCommandParser` passes the input string to `ParserUtil#filterByKeyword`, tokenize it and returns `FlashcardPredicate` for constructing `StatsCommand` object.

During the execution, `StatsCommand` updates the filtered flashcard list based on the predicate defined earlier. Then, all statistics from the filtered flashcards are fetched and aggregated by using the `Statistics#merge` API. Lastly, the success rate of the cumulative statistics is returned and is printed for the user.

When a user queries for statistics by using command `stats`, `StatsCommand` is the one to calculate the statistics. +
Currently, `StatsCommand` only supports an overall success rate from all user's flashcards. It will ask `Model` to +
return all of the flashcards and then merge each `Statistics` from each flashcard to return an overall cumulative +
`Statistics`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How statistics executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each individual `Flashcard` has exactly one `Statistics` attribute.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Flashcards are grouped by Tag, each of these groups store one overall `Statistics` attribute.
** Pros: Will use less memory.
** Cons: User has less flexibility in term of querying the statistics (User cannot know the statistics of a certain flashcard)

// end::statistics[]


// tag::share_import[]
===  Share & Import feature
==== Current Implementation: Share

the share command is implemented under the Logic component and allows users to share the collection of flashcards currently being displayed.
This is done by saving information of the cards to a text file; thereafter allowing users to manually distribute the
file to others.

The information which is saved by this command includes: front face text, back face text and
tags of each flashcard.

The share command takes `DIRECTORY_PATH` as the only argument, which specifies where the file should be saved.
The user's input is parsed by the `ShareCommandParser` class to make sure that the path specified exists and that it is
indeed a directory. The current implementation of the share command does not allow users to specify what
the file should be named. Instead, all files created by the command will be saved as _flashcards.txt_.

Since the share command only shares flashcards currently being displayed, it will often be used in
conjunction with the find command to update the model component before the share command is invoked by the user.
For example, if a user wants to share only chinese cards, the user will first enter `find t/chinese` followed by
`share DIRECTORY_PATH`.

The structure of the text file created by the command can be explained with the aid of the following screenshot:

image::ShareCommandTextFile.png[width="800"]

As shown form the screenshot, each line holds information for a single flashcard. The information is stored in the form
of add command arguments to ultimately simplify the import process _(see import feature)_.

It is important to note that the current implementation of the share command does not support the sharing of images.
This means that a flashcard containing an image will lose its image once shared as only the front face text, back face text
and tags are saved to the text file. However, sharing a card containing an image will not result in any error
or exception being thrown. Furthermore, the statistics of each flashcard are not shared as this would not make practical sense.

==== Current Implementation: Import

The import command is implemented under the logic component and allows users to add a collection of flashcards
from a text file to their existing collection.

The command takes `FILE_PATH` as the only argument which specifies the location of the file containing the cards to be imported.
The user's input is parsed by the `ImportCommandParser` class to make sure that the file specified exists and that it is
a text file.

The file used by the import command should be strictly limited to the file generated by the share command
and should not be altered. Altering the file in any way may effect the ability of the import command to read
in the cards correctly.

The implementation of the import command can be better visualised with the aid of the following sequence diagram:

image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

As shown from the sequence diagram, the `ImportCommand` class will read each line of the text file and call the `AddCommandParser` class to verify
the validity of the flashcard to be added. Once verified, the `execute` method of the `AddCommand` class will be
invoked to add the flashcard to the existing collection.

The import command will also keep track
of how many flashcards were successfully added in order to provide feedback to the user once the execution of
the command terminates.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to validate flashcards

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Validate flashcards at the Logic level using the `addCommandParser` class.
** Pros: Keeps the command contained at the Logic level of the project and is easier to implement.
** Cons: Increases dependency between the import command classes and the add command classes.
* **Alternative 2:** Validate flashcards at file level and append new flashcard data directly to the storage file
** Pros: Reduce dependency between classes, meaning that the import command is able to function without the add command.
** Cons: Harder to implement and bypasses several project components to directly interact with the storage component. This does not follow the overall
         architectural design of the project.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Card Collection depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all flashcards in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/CardCollectionParser.java[`CardCollectionParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/CardCollectionParser.java[`CardCollectionParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/cardcollection-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the card collection, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the card collection.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/CardCollection.java[`CardCollection`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/CardCollection.java[`CardCollection`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/CardCollection.java[`CardCollection`] allows you to update a flashcard, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/CardCollection.java[`CardCollection`]. Loop through each flashcard, and remove the `tag` from each flashcard.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `CardCollection#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/cardcollection-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your card collection application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a flashcard, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last flashcard in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside flashcard cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FlashcardCard.java[the `FlashcardCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `FlashcardCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/cardcollection-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/CardCollectionSystemTest.java[`CardCollectionSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and CardCollectionSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/cardcollection-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the card collection is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of flashcards when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleCardCollectionChangedEvent(CardCollectionChangedEvent)`] to update the number of flashcards whenever there are new changes to the cardcollection.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of flashcards status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/CardCollectionSystemTest.java[`CardCollectionSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of flashcards status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the card collection to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the card collection after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the card collection storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupCardCollection(ReadOnlyCardCollection)`, so that the card collection can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/CardCollectionStorage.java[`CardCollectionStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonCardCollectionStorage.java[`JsonCardCollectionStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `cardcollection`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular flashcard, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each flashcard, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a flashcard specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first flashcard to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first flashcard.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/CardCollectionParser.java[`CardCollectionParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/CardCollectionParserTest.java[`CardCollectionParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/CardCollectionParser.java[`CardCollectionParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/CardCollectionParserTest.java[`CardCollectionParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `FlashcardCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FlashcardCard.java[`FlashcardCard`] s to display a remark for each flashcard later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/FlashcardListCard.fxml[`FlashcardListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FlashcardCard.java[`FlashcardCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/FlashcardCardHandle.java[`FlashcardCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Face.java[`Face`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Flashcard` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the flashcard will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/cardcollection.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedFlashcard` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Flashcard` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedFlashcard.java[`JsonAdaptedFlashcard`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidFlashcardCardCollection.json`, `typicalFlashcardsCardCollection.json`, `validCardCollection.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `FlashcardBuilder`
Since `Flashcard` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/FlashcardBuilder.java[`FlashcardBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/flashcard/Flashcard.java[`Flashcard`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/FlashcardBuilder.java[`FlashcardBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the flashcard that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Flashcard` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalFlashcards.java[`TypicalFlashcards`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `FlashcardCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FlashcardCard.java[`FlashcardCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/FlashcardCard.java[`FlashcardCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Flashcard` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysFlashcard(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a flashcard.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
