== Introduction

Welcome to TeethHub!
If you are a dental practitioner who prefers to use a Command Line Interface (CLI),
then TeethHub is an application for you!

TeethHub works primarily through a CLI while having elements of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For example, you can select patients and records by clicking on them, but you would need to type the edit commands to edit them.
TeethHub allows you to keep track of your patient's particulars along with their dental records.
An image of each patient's teeth will also be displayed according to what you input for each tooth's status(Absent, Problem, Healthy).
In addition to that, TeethHub also allows you to keep track of your upcoming tasks, just like a calendar.

Interested in trying TeethHub out? Check out <<prerequisites>> to see what programs you need in order for TeethHub to work properly.

image::StatWindow.png[width="500"]

Generates a statistics report based on the specified patient's data. The generated report will contain all extended
patient information, a breakdown of all the records linked to the select patient parse in three different formats; a
table of records; a bar chart visualization; and a pie chart visualization.

Format: `stat INDEX`

// end::viewingInfo[]

==== exit
Exits the program. You won't be able to exit if copies exist.

Format: `exit`

[NOTE]
============================================================
You can also use `exit!` to forcefully exit the application
============================================================

=== File Management

TeethHub automatically saves all data to TeethHub.json when you close the program.
However, you can manage them manually with `open`, `save`, `import` and `export`. +
 +
*When we mention "data", we mean the patients list and their respective records plus the task list.* +

*.json files hold data that TeethHub can read. Use this to "save" or "load" your progress.* +
*.pdf files are easier for people to read. Use this if you are printing out a physical copy.*

You can use `open` to open another .json file that you may have transferred over from another computer. +
 +
You can use `save` to save specific patients to a .json or .pdf file. +
 +
You can use `import` to add specific patients from another .json file to your current data. +
 +
You can use `export` to save specific patients to a .json or .pdf file.

[NOTE]
============================================================
Look for your *saved* or *exported* files in the "data" folder. +
This is also where TeethHub looks for your files when you use `open` or `import`.
============================================================

[NOTE]
============================================================
The File Management Commands uses the following keywords!

`FILE_PATH`: +
Any letters in the English alphabet and numbers are allowed. +
Allowed special characters are: +
`! @ # $ % ^ & ( ) _ + - = { } [ ] ; ' , .` +
Special characters *NOT* allowed are: +
`< > : " | ? *`

`INDEX_RANGE`: +
Any positive integers (numbers with no decimals, must be greater than 0) are allowed.
You can use commas (no space) to choose multiple individual indexes. e.g. `1,3,5` for 1 and 3 and 5 +
You can use dash (no space) to choose a range of indexes. e.g. `3-5` for 3 to 5. `1-3-5` is not allowed, just use `1-5`. +
You can use a combination of commas and dashes to choose a range as well. e.g. `1-3,5` for 1 to 3 and 5. +
You can also type `all` instead to import/export everything.
*If you input a range that includes indexes that do not exist, the File Management commands will still run, but the indexes that do not exist will be ignored.* +
e.g. `import test.json 10-40` when there are only 30 patients in test.json. Patients 10 to 30 will be imported.
============================================================

==== open

image::OpenImportFeature3.png[width="522"]

`open` Opens a file of your choice and overwrites the current data with the file contents. +
** You can only open .json files.**

Format: `open FILE_PATH`

Examples:

* `open data1.json` +
This replaces the current data of TeethHub with the contents of "data1.json".

* `open february/data2.json` +
This replaces the current data of TeethHub with the contents of "data2.json" found in the "february" folder.


==== save
`save` Saves the current data to a file of your choice. +
All Tasks are also saved to that file. +
** You can only save to .json and .pdf.** +
.json files allow you to `open` or `import` them. +
.pdf files are easier to read, but you cannot open or import them with TeethHub.

Format: `save FILE_PATH`

Examples:

* `save data1.json` +
This saves the data currently in TeethHub to "data1.json".

* `save february/data2.pdf` +
This saves the data currently in TeethHub to "data2.json" in the "february" folder.


==== import

image::OpenImportFeature4.png[width="522"]

`import` Opens a file of your choice and adds patients of your choice to the current data. +
** You can only import .json files. **

Format: `import FILE_PATH INDEX_RANGE`

Examples:

* `import data1.json 1` +
This adds patient 1 from "data1.json" to the current data of TeethHub.

* `import february/data1.json 1` +
This adds patient 1 from "data1.json" found in the "february" folder to the current data of TeethHub.

* `import data1.json 1,4` +

image::SampleMc.png[width='600']
//end::rmc[]

=== Teeth Management
==== Teeth Create

There is no command required for this feature, as the application automatically generates and stores a new set of all healthy permanent teeth for newly added patients.

TeethHub complies with the most popular standard of the three the Dental Numbering Systems utilised in Dentistry - The Universal Numbering System.

ifdef::env-github[]
image::BaseLayer.png[width="200"]
endif::[]

The upper-case letters A through T are used for primary teeth and the
numbers 1 - 32 are used for permanent teeth. The tooth designated "1" is
the maxillary right third molar ("wisdom tooth") and the count continues
along the upper teeth to the left side. Then the count begins at the
mandibular left third molar, designated number 17, and continues along
the bottom teeth to the right side. Each tooth has a unique number or
letter, allowing for easier use on keyboards.

[NOTE]
At the moment, only the permanent teeth type is supported.

==== Teeth Edit

This command edits a specific tooth of a patient.

Format: `teethedit t/TEETH_LABEL s/STATUS`

* `TEETH_LABEL` are integers 1 to 32, which represents a tooth according to the Universal Numbering System.

* Valid `STATUS` are 0 (for healthy tooth), 1 (for problematic tooth), or 2 (for missing tooth).

Example:

* `<<goto, goto>> 1` - Specifies patient 1 to edit his or her teeth status. User enters the records mode.

* `teethedit t/31 s/2` - This edits the status of tooth 31 of the specified patient to missing.

* `<<back, back>>` - This command allows the user to exit the record edit mode, returning to the patients mode.

// end::patient_management_kyler[]

=== Task Management

In addition to patients, TeethHub also helps you store, display and manage your tasks so that you can improve your overall efficiency. Much like patients, you can interact with your tasks using specific commands to perform essential functions like adding, editing and deleting a task.

TeethHub helps you handle and differentiate the many tasks you might have by giving every task certain attributes that define them. You will need to know the various attributes a task can have before proceding to the commands that you can use to work with your tasks. Not to worry though, most attributes are basic information such as title of the task, the date and times of the task, making them very intuitive and easy to work with.

Table 1 below shows the list of parameters along with their respective descriptions.
Some attributes are bolded and marked with an asterisk `*`. These are **mandatory** attributes that should be provided when adding a task for the first time.

.Task parameters
|===
|Attribute |Description |Tag |Example

|*Title**
|General description for the task to be added.

You can provide any alphanumeric characters and the special characters:
`" ' ( ) @ ! ? . , -` when giving the title for the task. Other characters not specified will not be allowed
due to security reasons.
|ti/
|ti/Tooth Extraction

*|Start date**
|The date in which the task is set to begin.

You should provide the start date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY` and should not be a date that is BEFORE the current date.
You can also use the keyword `today` as an input which will use the current date as the start date.

Only *possible* dates are accepted as valid as the program follows the calendar strictly.
For example, `31-04-2019` will be flagged as invalid as there are only 30 days in April.

|sd/
|sd/19-12-2019

|End date
|The date in which the task is set to end.

You should provide the end date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`, following standard date values. The end date should not be
BEFORE the task's START DATE.
You can also use the keyword `today` as an input which will use the current date as the start date.

Other validity checks for the end date are the same as that of start date.

Default value if not specified: Task's start date.
|ed/
|ed/19-12-2019

|*Start time**
|The specific time in which the task is set to begin.

You should provide the time in the format `HHMM` (hours and minutes) and should also follow standard time values.

Only *possible* time values are accepted as valid inputs. For example, values such as `1265` or `2500` are not valid as
these are not time values used in the current world.
|st/
|st/0845

|*End time**
|The specific time in which the task is set to end.

You should provide the time in the format `HHMM` (hours and minutes) and should also follow standard time values.
If the task's start date and end date are the same, the end time should also not be BEFORE the start time.

Other validity checks for the end time are the same as that of the start time.
|et/
|et/1245

|Priority
|The priority level of the task to be performed.

You can provide the priority as `high`, `med`, `low` or `completed` in either upper or lowercase.
Tasks with different priority will be marked with different colored labels on the task list.
High priority will be marked [red]#red#, Medium priority be marked [orange]#orange# and
Low priority will be marked [yellow]#yellow#. Completed tasks will be marked with [green]#green#.

Default value if not specified: [yellow]#Low#
|pri/
|pri/high

|Patient
|The patient to be linked to the task. Linking a patient to a task, enables the <<taskdone, taskdone>> command to
 automatically add a record upon execution.

The patient's index must be a valid POSITIVE number and it can be found in the patient list next to the name.
If you want to set a task's linked patient to none, you can give this parameter
a value of `0` when using the <<taskedit, taskedit>> command. This parameter should not be included in task adding or
task editing when in <<goto, goto>> mode as the patient list is not visible in that mode. +


If a linked patient is <<edit, edited>>, fret not, TeethHub automatically updates the tasks for you.

If a patient is <<delete, deleted>> , you will be greeted with an alert box to let you decide between deleting the tasks associated with the patient, or setting those tasks to have no patient linked to them.

Default value if not specified: 0 (indicates that no patient is linked to the task)
|pat/

|===

With knowledge of the attributes that make up a task, you can now get to the actual interaction process, the task related commands.

==== taskadd
Adds a task to the application's list of tasks.

Format: `taskadd PARAMETERS` or `tadd PARAMETERS`

You can specify information that describes the task you wish to add by
keying in certain tags after the `taskadd` command. The `PARAMETERS` here refer to the task's attributes to be provided using their relevant tags.

Do note the following:

* All parameters have certain patterns that **MUST** be followed. +

* Some parameters are mandatory when adding a task. +

* Non-mandatory attributes will be assigned a default value if not specified.

*Mandatory* fields are TITLE `ti/`, START DATE `sd/`, START TIME `st/` and END TIME `et/`

[NOTE]
============================================================
Duplicate task will not be added into the program.

Tasks are considered duplicates if they have the *exact*
same TITLE, START DATE, START TIME, END TIME and
LINKED PATIENT
============================================================


[TIP]
You can use the `<<undo, undo>>` command to undo the results of this command, or `<<redo,redo>>` command to redo it.

Examples:

* `taskadd ti/Teeth Filling for Alex sd/14-09-2019 ed/14-09-2019 st/1200 et/1300 pri/HIGH
   pat/1`

* `taskadd ti/Regular review of all patients' records sd/10-10-2019 ed/15-10-2019 st/1200 et/0800 pri/low`

* `taskadd ti/Follow-up for Bernice sd/today st/1500 et/1600`

==== taskedit
Edits a task currently stored in the application

Format: `taskedit INDEX PARAMETERS` or `tedit INDEX PARAMETERS`

You can edit any attribute of the tasks as you wish and you can even provide multiple paramters in a single command and they will all be edited accordingly.

Take note of the following:

* Index of a task shown in the list **MUST** be specified +
* Index should be a positive number (e.g. 1,2,3..)
* Index of the tasks will be shown next to task's title in the task list
* Input tag of the field to modify followed by the new value to replace the old value
* Refer to *Table 1* above to see all the fields that can be modified
  along with their format and restrictions

[NOTE]
============================================================
Edit will not go through if task becomes a duplicate after the change.

Tasks are considered duplicates if they have the *exact*
same TITLE, START DATE, START TIME, END TIME and
LINKED PATIENT
============================================================

[TIP]
You can use the `<<undo, undo>>` command to undo the results of this command, or `<<redo,redo>>` command to redo it.

Examples:

* `taskedit 1 ti/Tooth Extraction for Alex`

* `taskedit 2 sd/15-09-2019 ed/15-09-2019 st/1400 et/1500`

* `taskedit 3 pat/0`

* `taskedit 1 ti/Braces removal for Bernice sd/05-05-2020 ed/05-05-2020 st/1500 et/1600 pri/MED`

==== taskdelete
Deletes a task from the task list

Format: `taskdelete 2` or `tdelete 2`

* Index of a task shown in the list **MUST** be specified +
* Index should be a positive number (e.g. 1,2...5)
* Index of the tasks will be shown next to task's title in the task list

You can delete tasks even if they are not completed or even if the task's start date has not come to pass. For tasks with a patient linked to them, you can safely delete the task if you wish to as it has no effect on the patient linked to the task.

[TIP]
You can use the `<<undo, undo>>` command to undo the results of this command, or `<<redo,redo>>` command to redo it.

Example:

* `taskdelete 1`
* `<<taskcal, taskcal>> 25-12-2019` +
  `taskdelete 2`

//tag::tcopy[]
==== taskcopy
Makes one or multiple copies of a task in the task list. This is useful when adding multiple tasks share similar attributes.

Format: `taskcopy INDEX [COUNT]` or `tcopy INDEX [COUNT]`

Note: If the copied entry is modified, it will no longer be considered as a copy. Thus, it should be different from existing entries in the task list. If copies exist before existing, there will be a confirmation.

Example:

* `taskcopy 1` - Make one copy of the 1st task in task list.

* `taskcopy 1 2` - Make two copies of the 1st task in task list.

==== tasklist
Shows a list of all the task stored in the application.

Format: `tasklist` or `tlist`

==== tasksort
Sort the tasks ascendingly or descendingly in some order.

Format : `tasksort PARAMETER [asce/desc]` or `tsort PARAMETER [asce/desc]`

Note :

* `PARAMETER` can be `starttime`, `endtime` or  `priority`
* The `asc/desc` is optional. It's sorted `ascendingly` by default

Example:

* `tasksort priority`

* `tasksort starttime desc`
//end::tcopy[]

// tag::task_ppp_cchj1995[]
==== taskdone
Sets a task to `[green]#complete#`, marking the completion of the task.

Format: `taskdone INDEX`

Tasks marked as complete will have their priority replaced with a green tag that says COMPLETED as illustrated by Figure 1 below:

image::Taskdone.png[width=""]

Figure 1: Image showing the change in a task's priority tag after completion.


If you execute this command on a task with a patient linked to it, TeethHub will help you add a record to the patient automatically.
The added record will use the task's title as its description. Figure 2 shows you an example of the outcome of running the command on a task with a linked patient.

image::Taskdone2.png[width=""]

Figure 2: Image showing the added record after completing a task.

[NOTE]
You can use the `undo` command to set a completed task back to its original priority. However, the added record will remain in the patient as of the current implementation of TeethHub.

[NOTE]
====
If you use the `redo` command immediately after the `undo` command, the task will be set back to being completed, but a new record will not be added. You can execute another `taskdone` command after the `undo`  to add another record to the linked patient.
====
Example:

* `taskdone 2`
* `<<taskcal, taskcal>>` +
  `taskdone 1`

==== taskcal
Creates a popup window with a list of tasks on the left hand side of the window and a calendar on the right hand side. The calendar will load the dates for the month and year of the given date.
There will also be a command box below the calendar, allowing you to execute task mangement commands and navigate to other dates.

[NOTE]
Executing the command without specifying a date will cause the calendar to load into the current date.

Format: `taskcal` or `taskcal DD-MM-YYYY`

Figure 3 below shows the the displayed window and its key components

image::TaskCalendarUG.png[width=""]

Figure 3: Image showing the entire task calendar window with labelled components


As seen from Figure 3, you can view tasks that either start or end on a particular date from the task list. You can also see in the calendar pane that certain date cells highlighted in colored circles. These signify that there are tasks on those particular dates. The cells are colored according to the highest priority task for the date. This also means that you do not have any tasks that start or have their deadlines on dates that are not marked with a colored circle.


Using Figure 3 as an example, the date `29-03-2019` is colored in red which matches the highest priority task on that day which is `HIGH`. You can also focus into any of the dates in the calendar to change the task list to display the tasks for that date. To choose a date to focus into, you can either key a date directly into the command box in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`, or simply click on the date cells with a mouse.

You can execute task related commands such as `taskadd`, `taskedit`, `taskdelete` and `tasklist` from the command box in this window to interact with tasks.

[NOTE]
Executing the `taskcal` command inside this popup window without specifying a date will cause the calendar to load into the current date.

The top pane of the calendar has clickable arrows that lets you change the calendar page to display the dates for different months and years. Figure 4 below shows a focused view of the calendar's top pane:

// end::task_ppp_cchj1995[]

////
==== taskfind
Searches for and displays a list of tasks according to a specified parameter

Format: `taskfind PARAMETER` or `tfind PARAMETER`

You can specify any parameter that a task contains when using this command.
No tasks will be display if none of the tasks match the search conditions.

Examples:

* `taskfind pri/HIGH`
* `taskfind ti/Extraction`

=== Suggestion Commands
Sometimes, you may forget the exact way to type some commands or you may get confused. +
After all, Patient Management has `patientadd`, Records Management has `recordadd` and Task Management has `taskadd`! +
Even worse, some commands cannot be used in certain modes. +
If this ever happens, you can either open the <<help, help>> window again, or simply type out their common word due to our suggestion commands!

The Suggestion commands are: `add`, `clear`, `copy`, `delete`, `edit`, `find`, `list`, `select` and `sort`.

Suppose if you want to add something but you have forgotten the exact command. +
Simply enter `add`, and TeethHub will ask you if you meant `patientadd` or `recordadd` or `taskadd`. +
Don't worry about the commands that cannot be used in your current mode; the Suggestion commands will only suggest commands that can be used in your current mode.

For example, if you were to type `add` in Patient Mode, you will see `patientadd` and `taskadd`:

image::SuggestionFeatureAddPatientMode.png[width="236"]

If you were to type `add` in Record Mode, you will see `recordadd` and `taskadd` instead:

== Planned Implementations

=== Patient Teeth per record [Coming in v1.5]
Currently, TeethHub stores and displays the latest teeth image of each patient.
We understand that you may want to see teeth changes over time.
In v1.5, TeethHub will be able to store and display a teeth image for each record.

=== Adding images to records [Coming in v1.6]
Currently, TeethHub is not equipped to accept images from you.
We understand that you may want to store x-rays of teeth or other relevant images you have taken.
In v1.6, TeethHub will have a new command for you to upload images.

=== Spell-Checker Functionality [Coming in v1.7]
Currently, TeethHub does not have a spell checker.
It would be great if TeethHub would automatically correct an improperly typed command(e.g. sirt to sort).
In v1.7, TeethHub will have a spell checker functionality.

=== Store procedure costs and fees [Coming in v1.8]
TeethHub currently allows users to store procedural records and tasks.
Eventually, TeethHub would be able to allow its user to customize costs to
each procedure and tasks.

=== Bill Generation [Coming in v1.9]
TeethHub would eventually be able to help its user calculate and generate bills
when a patient finishes a check-up or procedure done by its user. This allows our
users to integrate billings with patients and tasks, allowing all necessary
interactions to be done on TeethHub.

// tag::2.0_kyler[]
=== Support for Primary Teeth Type [Coming in v2.0]

To allow the application to truly be able to cater for all dental patients of our user.

=== Implementation of Other Teeth Numbering Standards [Coming in v2.0]

TeethHub can adopt other common teeth numbering standards such as the ISO System or Palmer notation method.
This allows our users to pick the numbering standard they are most familiar with.

// end::2.0_kyler[]

=== Cloud Functionality [Coming in v2.0]

Currently, TeethHub is not connected to a cloud.
To increase data redundancy and reduce the risk of data being lost,
you should be able to synchronise your data with a cloud account.
In v2.0, TeethHub will be synchronized with a cloud server.

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

*A*: Install TeethHub in the other computer and overwrite the empty data
file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous
Address Book folder. Alternatively, upload your data to the cloud and
download it from there.
