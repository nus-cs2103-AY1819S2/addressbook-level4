This portfolio serves to document my contributions to https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main[*_ePiggy_*]. +

== Overview of *_ePiggy_*
*_ePiggy_* is a simplified expense tracker for students.
It is used to record allowances, expenses, goals, and budgets.
It has student-centric features that makes managing their money easier.

*_ePiggy_* was build based of a basic command line interface AddressBook for a software engineering project.
My team and I decided to build ePiggy because we wanted to teach students to start managing their expenses from young, through the use of basic coding, and in a manner that relates to them.

My primary role was to develop the allowance and goal setting feature.
The following sections show these enhancements in more detail, as well as
additional features that I added to the user and developer guides on top of these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my code, documentation, and other contributions to the team project.

=== Major Enhancements
I implemented the `Allowance` feature which comprises of 3 commands: `addAllowance`, `editAllowance`, and `deleteAllowance`.
[none]
* *What it does:*
** The 3 commands allow the user to record inflows of money (mainly allowances from parents
since our target audience is students)
* *Justification:*
** By recording down the allowances that the user receives, *_ePiggy_* will be able to calculate the
net amount of money that the user has. Knowing this information will be useful to the user.
** Apart from the user, knowing the net amount of money is also crucial to the savings goal feature
which will be further explained below.
* *Highlights:*
** Together with the `Expense` feature, the `Allowance` feature is one of the main functions that
is the core of *_ePiggy_*.
** I worked together with my team member Minh, who was in charge of the `Expense` feature, to
integrate `Expenses` and `Allowances` together seamlessly in the calculation of net savings.
** Extensive testing of the `Allowance` feature is required to ensure that the basic function of
*_ePiggy_* is working.

=== Minor Enhancements
I also implemented the goal setting feature, which comprises of the `setGoal` command.
[none]
* *What it does:*
** `setGoal` allows the user to set the name and the amount of their savings goal.
** The savings goal will be displayed on the `SavingsPanel` of the User Interface, together
with the amount the user has to save up in order to reach the goal.
* *Justification:*
** This is one of the student-centric features that is one of the main selling points of *_ePiggy_*.
** By allowing users to set a goal, and to show the difference between their current savings
and goal, we hope to motivate users to save up enough money to buy the things they want, instilling
the value of saving money at a young age.
* *Highlights:*
** This feature requires an accurate calculation of net savings in order to calculate the
amount required for the user to save up to reach the savings goal.

== Contributions to the User Guide
We had to write a new User Guide as most of the sections in the AddressBook User Guide was not applicable to our application.
Below is an excerpt from the *ePiggy User Guide*, showing additions I made for the `addAllowance`, `deleteAllowance`, `editAllowance` and `setGoal` commands.
They showcase my ability to write user manuals targeting end-users.

The full User Guide for *_ePiggy_* can be found https://cs2103-ay1819s2-w17-4.github.io/main/UserGuide.html[here].

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
The following section shows my additions to the developer guide for the `addAllowance`, `deleteAllowance`, `editAllowance` and `setGoal` commands.
They showcase the technical depth of my contributions as well as the ability to convey
technical information to other developers clearly.
