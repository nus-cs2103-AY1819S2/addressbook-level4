== [underline]#Introduction#
Welcome to my Project Portfolio. This document provides you with an
overview of my contributions to the project I have worked on, {uri-pdfplusplus}[((PDF++))]

== [underline]#About PDF++#

// Background info
Most university students have one thing in common, messy desktop.
As a student, I have to manage multiple new documents weekly.
Furthermore, each file is categorised differently or has a different unique purpose.
For instance, I would look for files from my programming modules on certain algorithm
concepts or look from my language module for files with writing tips. However, the current
File Management System (FMS), such as File Explorer in Windows, has its limitations
in the categorisation of files. Even for organised users, it is ineffective to
make a constant effort maintaining the documents in an orderly manner, and inefficient
switching between folders to look for the files of their interest. My team and I
recognised this limitation and decided to work on building an elaborated FMS, PDF++.

=== Project Scope
//Project scope
For the team project, we were provided with an existing {uri-addressbook}[AddressBook]
application. We decided to morph the application into PDF++, a sophisticated FMS
targeting students who prefer working with Command Line Interface (CLI). However,
given the limitation of the project, our application currently supports PDF
files only, and thus the name.

=== Main role and contributions
// main role and contributions
I am one of the {uri-aboutus}[developers] for PDF++ that in charge of
implementing {uri-fileprotection}[*File Protection*] feature and most of the
test cases for the Logic component.

== [underline]#Summary of contributions#

This section highlights my key contributions to the documentation, coding and
technical aspects for the PDF++ project.

=== Robust File Protection System

PDF++ not only supports several essential features, such as {uri-add}[add] and
{uri-open}[open] features, it also has a built-in sophisticated
{uri-fileprotection}[File Protection System] (FPS).

For FPS, I have incorporated both `encrypt` and
`decrypt` features and other improvements that enforce the security of the application.

This allows the users to protect sensitive data such that only authorised personnel to have access to.
Similarly, users can remove the security of the document with the password that was previously set.
During this process of file protection, we have disabled some features, such as `history` and pressing up
on the command box that will potentially reveal the password of the documents.

Though this system, users can safely rely on PDF++ for the protection of their files, without the fear of
exposing their passwords which compromise their privacy.

=== Test Cases for Logic Component

PDF++ offers many advanced features that have a complex implementation. Due to the complexity of the code,
it is ideally that we have the comprehensive {uri-remainingautotests}[test cases] for each command before the actual implementation of the features.
This requires an in-depth knowledge of our code base and discussion with my team on how the feature should be implemented.

* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=weitanglau[Project Code Dashboard]

=== Technical Leadership
//Show examples of code for team to reuse

For this project, we decided to make a complete overhaul from the existing code that works with imaginary data
to support actual file manipulation. This would require many initial adjustments in enabling our application to accept
PDF documents. I have made significant contributions to the {uri-refactorpdf}[refactoring] of *Person* class to *Pdf* class.
Furthermore, for future expansion of features, I have implemented the {uri-addcommand}[add command]. These initial ground work
allows my team to test their code using the GUI with the pdf files they have added.

=== File Protection: `encrypt` & `decrypt`

PDF++ offers native support for file protection.
The command `encrypt` allows you to protect your files with a password such that
they cannot be accessed without the password.
Similarly, the command `decrypt` allows you to remove the password that
you had set for the file.

image:{imagesDir}/lightbulb.png[width="30"]
----
The terms "protect" and "encrypt" will be used interchangeably.
----

The *Encrypt* and *Decrypt* feature has the following syntax:

[.big]#Format: `encrypt INDEX password/PASSWORD` [For Encryption]# +
[.big]#Format: `decrypt INDEX password/PASSWORD` [For Decryption]#

* `INDEX` refers to the index of the file on the list that you wish to encrypt/decrypt.
* `PASSWORD` refers to the password which you wish to assign to the particular file.

Examples:

* `encrypt 2 password/ThisIsNotASecurePassword`
* `decrypt 2 password/ThisIsNotASecurePassword`

Please refer to <<steps-encrypt, Encryption Guide>> or <<steps-decrypt, Decryption Guide>>
for help in using these features.

==== Encryption Guide

image:{imagesDir}/warning-icon.png[width="30"]
----
"encrypt" feature will not work on files that are already encrypted.
----

Illustrated below is a sample usage scenario that provides a clear view of the inner workings
of the Encrypt feature.

Step 1: Launch the application by double clicking the `pdfplusplus.jar`.

Step 2: Select the file that you wish to encrypt via the `INDEX` on the list.

Step 3: Enter the `encrypt` command into the text box, following the syntax as
illustrated below.

* `encrypt 2 password/ThisIsNotASecurePassword`

Step 4: Upon hitting enter to execute the command, your inputs are verified and if successful,
your selected file is encrypted with the given password.

image:{imagesDir}/lightbulb.png[width="30"]
----
Upon successful encryption, there will be a lock icon at the bottom right of the card
to indicate that the file is an encrypted file.
----

=== Proposed feature in v2.0
* Login Page: +
We plan to include a Login Page to help authenticate you to the application so that you can access the app more securely.

Furthermore, together with the connection to external servers feature, this feature will allow you to access your documents
anywhere you are.

=== File Protection System

PDF++ has a robust in-built file protection system which allows you to encrypt or decrypt any
PDF files you want. These features utilises the
https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi#20x[_Apache PDFBox® library_], specifically the
https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/PDDocument.html[_PDDocument_],
https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/encryption/AccessPermission.html[_AccessPermission_], and
https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/encryption/StandardProtectionPolicy.html[_StandardProtectionPolicy_].

image:{imagesDir}/lightbulb.png[width="30"]

An encrypted file is a file that is protected with a password. The terms "protect" and "encrypt" will be used interchangeably.
----

You can visit <<Encryption feature>> and <<Decryption feature>> to understand more about the respective feature.

==== Encryption feature

===== Current Implementation
The `encrypt` feature is facilitated by both *EncryptCommand* and *EncryptCommandParser*.

The implementation of the *EncryptCommand* is summarised in the following activity diagram:

image::EncryptCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

. The provided index is checked for validity i.e. referring to a specific Pdf in PdfBook.
.. If the index is invalid, a *CommandException* will be thrown and the execution ends.
. The Pdf specified via the index is retrieved from the PdfBook.
. A `File` object is created for the Pdf.
. The `File` will be loaded as https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/PDDocument.html[_PDDocument_],
which is an indicator that the `File` is a *PDF* document that is uncorrupted and
not protected with a password.
.. Error in loading Pdf as *PDDocument* would throw an *IOException*. Common reasons of error are:
... File not found in the location
... Lack of user permissions to open File
... Protected, corrupted File
.. Thrown IOException is intercepted, a *CommandException* will be thrown and the execution ends.
. https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/encryption/AccessPermission.html[_AccessPermission_] and
https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/encryption/StandardProtectionPolicy.html[_StandardProtectionPolicy_]
are created. The password specified will be passed to `StandardProtectionPolicy` for the purpose of setting security settings for the
`PDDocument`.
. A protected Pdf will be saved and closed.
.. Error in encrypting the file will throw an *IOException*. Common reasons of error are:
... Excessive long password
... Empty password
.. Thrown IOException is intercepted, a *CommandException* will be thrown and the execution ends.
. The Pdf is recorded in the {uri-model}[Model component] and the changes are saved.
. A *CommandResult* is returned upon successful exception of *EncryptCommand*.

This sequence diagram demonstrates the Main Success Scenario from the
*LogicManager* to the end of *EncryptCommand* execution:

image::EncryptCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations

===== Edit password of an encrypted file

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Execute *DecryptCommand* then *EncryptCommand*

** Due to security reasons, it was decided to focus on encrypting an unprotected Pdf.
You will need to use <<Decryption feature, Decryption>> feature
before encrypting it with a new password. This is to ensure your intent in changing the password,
as the current version *PDF++* does not support `Forget Password` feature.

** However, this process is inefficient as you will need to enter 2 commands instead of 1.

* Alternative 2: Change the password of an encrypted file

** This minimised the number of commands to be executed, but there are several security concerns as mentioned above.

===== A sophisticated protection system

* Multiple adjustments to protect your interest

. {uri-historycommand}[History] feature will not show the executed `EncryptCommand` which includes the password of the file.
. The {uri-undoredocommand}[Undo/Redo] feature is temporarily disabled until a solution that
will not comprise your privacy has been found.
. Pressing up in the command box will not show the `EncryptCommand` that was previously executed.

===== Future Implementation

There are concerns of accidental encryption of a file with a wrong password. In *PDF++* v2.0,
the *EncryptCommand* will prompt you to re-enter the password as a form of confirmation message.
If there is a mismatch of the two passwords entered, the command will not be executed.

==== Decryption feature

===== Current Implementation

image:{imagesDir}/lightbulb.png[width="30"]
----
The current Implementation of *DecryptCommand* is very similar to Encryption feature.
The part where it is implemented differently will be specifically marked with a `*` for your convenience.
----

The `decrypt` feature is facilitated by both *DecryptCommand* and *DecryptCommandParser*.

The implementation of the `DecryptCommand` execution is summarised in the following activity diagram.

image::DecryptCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]

. The provided index is checked for validity i.e. referring to a specific Pdf in PdfBook.
.. If the index is invalid, a *CommandException* will be thrown and the execution ends.
. The Pdf specified via the index is retrieved from the PdfBook.
. A `File` object is created for the Pdf.
. The `File` will be loaded as https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.1/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/PDDocument.html[_PDDocument_]
with the specified password, which is an indicator that the `File` is a *PDF* document that is uncorrupted, protected and the password
provided is valid *.
.. Error in loading Pdf as *PDDocument* would throw an *IOException* and invalid password would throw a *CommandException*.
Common reasons of error are:
... File not found in location
... Lack of user permissions to open File
... Unprotected File *
... Corrupted File
... Wrong password *
.. Thrown IOException is intercepted, a *CommandException* will be thrown and the execution ends.
. Upon success loading of the PDDocument, the security will be removed. *
. An unprotected * Pdf will be saved and closed.
. The Pdf is recorded in the {uri-model}[Model component] and the changes are saved.
. A *CommandResult* is returned upon successful exception of *DecryptCommand*.

This sequence diagram demonstrates the Main Success Scenario from the
*LogicManager* to the end of *DecryptCommand* execution:

image::DecryptCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations

===== A sophisticated protection system

* Multiple adjustments to protect your interest

. {uri-historycommand}[History] will not show the executed `EncryptCommand` which includes the password of the file.
. The {uri-undoredocommand}[Undo/Redo] feature is temporarily disabled until a solution that
will not comprise your privacy has been found.
. Pressing up in the command box will not show the `EncryptCommand` that was previously executed.

===== Future Implementation

If an unauthorised personnel obtained the password of your files through illegal means,
they can potentially set the file with a new password. This will hinder your access to
your files.

However, With 2-Factor Authentication, there is an additional layer of protection
that prevents these personnel from changing the passwords of your files. This
ensures that only you/any authorised personnel can decrypt your files.

In *PDF++* v2.0, the *DecryptCommand* will support for the 2FA feature as mentioned above.
If this feature is highly demanded, this feature will be implemented to *EncryptCommand* too.
