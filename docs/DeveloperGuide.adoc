Welcome Developers! Thank you for your interest to contribute to Club Manager!

By: `W13-2`      Since: `Jan 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

= About This Guide
This guide provides a technical overview of Club Manager and walks you through the installation process.
Furthermore, this guide documents all of the features available in Club Manager, and covers everything that you need to know before you begin contributing to Club Manager.

== Introduction
Club Manager is a desktop application that enables CCA leaders to manage their members and activities effectively and efficiently.
To learn more about installation, proceed to Section 2 (Installation Guide).

== Installation Guide
This section serves to guide you through the setting up process of Club Manager's development environment.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram2.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::modes_of_operation[]
=== Operation mode control feature
==== Current Implementation

ClubManager is designed to manage members and activities and allow the user to link members to the activities.
To synchronize the user interface to show appropriate information when users are doing different operation and to minimize confusion the following feature has been added.
With the implementation of modes of operations which only allows commands to be executed in their respective modes.

For example when ClubManager is in Member Mode, only member commands can be called (for example memberAdd, memberEdit etc.)

.ClubManager in MEMBER mode
image::appInMemberMode.png[width="800"]

Calling an activity command will result in an error.

.Error when Activity Command is called in MEMBER mode
image::appInMemberModeCallingActivityCmd.png[width="800"]

General commands can be called in any mode (for example help and exit)

Currently the app has 2 modes of operation, namely member mode and activity mode.

A coloured label on the top right corner indicates the mode of operation at any time to let the user easily track which mode the app is operating in.

image::ModeMemberLabel.png[width="200"]

.Indicator for mode in the Window
image::ModeActivityLabel.png[width="200"]

==== Design of operation mode control
Each Command extends a CommandType, currently MemberCommand, ActivityCommand and GeneralCommand
For each CommandType, there is an ArrayList of modes in where this category of command can operate in as seen in the class diagram.

For example, for the MemberSelectCommand extends MemberCommands which the ArrayList of AppMode.Modes contains the MEMBER mode enumeration.
Which means that the MemberSelectCommand can only operate when ClubManager is in MEMBER mode.

.Example of Class Diagram for Member Commands
image::memberCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800px"]

When the Command is created, it instantiates the operation modes. And when the execute function of the Command is called, the app would allow the execution of the command if the current app mode can be found within the the allowed mode list of the command.
If the mode does not match, it will throw an exception preventing the execution and prompting the user to change the app mode (by using the mode command) before calling such a function.

For example if mLIst (alias of memberList) command is called the following process occurs to either execute the command or throw the InvalidCommandModeException exception for the case that the command is called in the wrong mode.

.Sequence diagram of mode control
image::commandModeControl.png[width="800px"]

==== Design Consideration to aid future expansion of app

* The design approach of the mode of operation control allows easy expansion of the app to manage more categories if required as the allowed modes of operation can be added to the ArrayList.
* The feature is designed with easy reuse in mind by allowing the checking of mode to be done dynamically.
* Since the modes which the command can operate in is stored as an ArrayList, future implementation of more modes of operation, can be added to the list. The current function to check the allowed mode will still be valid.
* The design also allows the type of command to operate in and not be restricted to either a single mode or all modes but also any combination of modes.

// end::modes_of_operation[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// end::undoredo[]

//tag::memberlistfeature[]
=== Member List Feature
The Member's List is a core feature that underpins Club Manager's role as a CCA management system.
To ensure versatility and enhance the usefulness of this list, a number of commands have been introduced to facilitate the management of members. These commands include: `MemberAdd`, `MemberDelete`, `MemberEdit`, `MemberFilter`, `MemberFind`, `MemberList`, `MemberSelect`, and `MemberSort`.

==== Current Implementation
===== Model Component

.Updated Model Component Class Diagram for Member List
image::person-attributes.png[width=50%]

// end::memberlistfeature[]

// tag::memberadd[]
===== `memberAdd` Command
This command takes in a number of parameters that are contact and student information pertaining to the member. The `MemberAddCommandParser` requires that all field are present, in the required format, with the exception of tags which are optional.

.Activity Diagram of Validations and Checks for MemberAddCommand
image::memberadd_validation.png[width=100%]

Below is a step-by-step process on how the memberAdd command works on execution:

* *Step 1:* The User executes the `memberAdd` command
* *Step 2:* The `memberAdd` command calls the `Model#hasPerson()` to prevent duplicated members from being added to the member's list.
* *Step 3:* Then, the `memberAdd` call `Model#hasMatricNumber` to prevent duplication of matric number within the member's list. This is because matric number are unique and no two students can have the same matric number.
* *Step 4:* Once these verification have been completed, the `memberAdd` command calls `Model#addPerson` to proceed with adding the member to the member's list.
* *Step 5:* The `memberAdd` calls `Model#commitAddressBook()` to finalise the changes made to the patient record.
* *Step 6:* Finally, the `memberAdd` command provides a success message to indicate that the member has been successfully added to Club Manager.

The following code snippet shows how the `memberAdd` command is executed:
[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);

        if (model.hasPerson(toAdd)) { # <1>
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON);
        } else if (model.hasMatricNumber(toAdd.getMatricNumber())) { # <2>
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_MATRICNUMBER);
        }
        model.addPerson(toAdd); # <3>
        model.commitAddressBook();
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, toAdd));
    }
----
<1> Check if member already exists in Club Manager.
<2> Check if the matric number entered is unique.
<3> Add member to Club Manager.
//end::memberadd[]

//tag::memberdelete[]
===== `memberDelete` Command
The `memberDelete` command deletes a person (based on index) from the addressbook.

Below is a step-by-step process on how the `memberDelete` command works on execution:

* *Step 1:* The user executes the `memberDelete` command by specifying the index of the member that the user would like to delete.
* *Step 2:* The `memberDelete` command will call `model#getFilteredPersonList` to retrieve the members list.
* *Step 3:* Next, the `memberDelete` command will call `lastShownList#get` from which the given index will be used to pin point the specific
member in the `filteredPersonList`.
* *Step 4:* Then, the `memberDelete` command will call `model#removeMemberFromAllAttendance` to remove the member from all actvities using the member's matriculation number.
* *Step 5:* Afterwards, the `memberDelete` command will call `model#deletePerson` to delete the person from the Club Manager.
* *Step 6:* Thereafter, the `memberDelete` command will call `model#commitAddressBook` to commit the changes to Club Manager.
* *Step 7:* Finally, the `memberDelete` command provides a success message to indicate that the member has been successfully deleted from Club Manager.

The following code snippet shows how `memberDelete` command is executed:
[source,java]
----
@Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        List<Person> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList(); # (1)

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX); # (2)
        }

        Person personToDelete = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased()); # (3)
        model.removeMemberFromAllAttendance(personToDelete.getMatricNumber()); # (4)
        model.deletePerson(personToDelete); # (5)
        model.commitAddressBook();
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_DELETE_PERSON_SUCCESS, personToDelete));
    }
----
<1> Gets filtered person list
<2> Checks if index is valid
<3> Gets person from filtered person list
<4> Gets person's matriculation number and removes it from all activities
<5> Delete person from address book
//end::memberdelete[]

//tag::memberedit[]
===== `memberEdit` Command
The `memberEdit` command edits a member's information.

Below is a step-by-step process on how the `memberEdit` command works on execution:

* *Step 1:* The user executes the `memberEdit` command by specifying the index of the member that the user would like to edit, followed by the prefix and information to be overwritten.
* *Step 2:* The `memberEdit` command will call `model#getFilteredPersonList` to retrieve the members list.
* *Step 3:* Next, the `memberEdit` command will call `lastShownList#get` from which the given index will be used to pin point the specific
member in the `filteredPersonList`.
* *Step 4:* Then, the `memberEdit` command will call `createEditedPerson` to create a new member using the new information.
* *Step 5:* Afterwards, the `memberEdit` command will call `model#SetPerson` to replace the outdated member in the Club Manager.
* *Step 6:* Thereafter, the `memberEdit` command will call `model#updateFilteredPersonList` to update the filtered person list.
* *Step 7:* Finally, the `memberDelete` command provides a success message to indicate that the member has been successfully deleted from Club Manager.

The following code snippet shows how `memberEdit` command is executed:
[source,java]
----
 @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        List<Person> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList(); # (1)

        if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX); # (2)
        }

        Person personToEdit = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased()); # (3)
        Person editedPerson = createEditedPerson(personToEdit, editPersonDescriptor); # (4)

        if (!personToEdit.isSamePerson(editedPerson) && model.hasPerson(editedPerson)) { # (5)
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON);
        }

        model.setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson); # (6)
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS); # (7)
        model.commitAddressBook();
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_EDIT_PERSON_SUCCESS, editedPerson));
    }
----
<1> Gets filtered person list
<2> Checks if index is valid
<3> Gets person from filtered person list
<4> Creates new person using new information
<5> Checks if the new person created is the same as the old person
<6> Replace old entry of person with updated person
<7> Update filtered person list to show changes

//end::memberedit[]

//tag::memberfind[]
===== `memberFind` Command
The `memberFind` command finds all members in Club Manager that contain the keywords in their name or matricnum (as specified in command).

Below is a step-by-step process on how the `memberFind` command works on execution:

* *Step 1:* The user executes the `memberFind` command by specifying the criteria and keyword(s)of the member that the user would like to find.
* *Step 2:* The `memberFind` command will call `model#getFilteredPersonList` to retrieve the members list of members whose name contains the name keywords or matricnum contains the matricnum keywords.
* *Step 3:*  Finally, the `memberFind` command shows an overview of the number of members found, and displays the members found.

The following code snippet shows how `memberFind` command is executed:
[source,java]
----
@Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) {
        requireNonNull(model);

        if (predicate.toString().equalsIgnoreCase("name")) { # (1)
            model.updateFilteredPersonList(namePredicate); # (2)
        } else if (predicate.toString().equalsIgnoreCase("matricnum")) { # (3)
            model.updateFilteredPersonList(matricNumPredicate); # (4)
        }
        return new CommandResult(
                String.format(Messages.MESSAGE_PERSONS_LISTED_OVERVIEW, model.getFilteredPersonList().size()));
    }
----
<1> Checks if criteria given is "name"
<2> Updates filtered person list with members whose names contain the keyword
<3> Checks if criteria given is "matricnum"
<4> Updates filtered person list with members whose matriculation number contain the keyword

The `memberFilter` command retrieves members (based on a filter criteria) from the `UniquePersonList` and displays these members on the `PersonListPanel`.

Below is a step-by-step process on how the `memberFilter` command works on execution:

* Step 1: The user executes the `memberFilter` command.
* Step 2: The `memberFilter` command parser will check if the filter category entered by the user is valid. Note that this is case-insensitive.
* Step 3: Thereafter, the `memberFilter` command parser will concatenate the keywords (if there are more than one keyword). This will allow users to filter majors with multiple words.
* Step 4: The `memberFilter` command will then call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList` to filter the member's list based on the given criteria.
* Step 4 (Continued): In this process, based on the criteria provided, the relevant predicate class
(e.g. `YearOfStudyContainsKeywordsPredicate`) will be used and its test method will be called to test if the member in the member's list has an exact match of the given keyword. This gradually filters the member's list. Do note, however,
the list generated will given as it is (no sorting carried out). Depending on the initial ordering of the member's list, the list may or may not appear to be sorted.
* Step 5: The `memberFilter` command will then call `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the filtered member's list.
* Step 6: Finally, the memberFilter command provides a success message to indicate that the member's list has been successfully filtered.

====== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* Predicate Classes

To check if the user input matches the correct criteria, there are various ways. Below are some options:

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Check through MemberFilterCommandParser Class

** Pros : More organised and logical as parser classes handle the user input.
** Cons : May be less efficient as check has to be done through looping through the criteria one by one.

* *Alternative 2*: Check through individual predicate classes.

** Pros: More time efficient as only one check is required.
** Cons: Less logical and could prove to be confusing to the developer.

==== Future Implementation
For future implementation, the `memberFilter` command could allow more than one filter, which will further allow the user to target a specific subset of members.

// end::memberfilter[]

// tag::memberlist[]
===== `memberList` Command
The `memberList` command retrieves all the members in the `UniquePersonList` and displays all these members on the `PersonListPanel`.

Below is a step-by-step process on how the `memberList` command works on execution:

* Step 1: The user executes the `memberList` command.
* Step 2: The `memberList` command will then call the `Model#UpdateFilteredPersonList()` to retrieve all the members in the UniquePersonList.
* Step 3: The `memberList` provide the command success message to indicate that the member list has been successfully listed.
//end::memberlist[]

// tag::memberselect[]
===== `memberSelect` Command

The `memberSelect` command selects a member (based on index) on the `UniquePersonList`.

Below is a step-by-step process on how the `memberSelect` command works on execution:

* *Step 1:* The user executes the `memberSelect` command by specifying the index of the member that the user would like to select.
* *Step 2:* The `memberSelect` command will call `model#getFilteredPersonList` to retrieve the member's list.
* *Step 3:* Next, the `memberSelect` command will call `model#setSelectedPerson` from which the given index will be used to pin point the specific
member in the `filteredPersonList`.
* *Step 4:* Finally, the `memberSelect` command will show a command success message to indicate the member at the specified index has been successfully selected.

The `memberSelect` command is naturally tied with the User Interface.

.Updated Ui Component Class Diagram
image::updatedUIcomponent.png[width=50%]

When a member is selected, the `memberDetailPanel` will populate the information of the selected person. The `ActivitiesAttendedByMemberPanel` will also populate the activities that are attended by member.
For the population of member statistics, it is less straightforward. The calling flow is UI to Logic to Model. This is illustrated in the diagram below.

.Sequence Diagram of MemberSelectCommand
image::memberselect_sequence.png[width=50%]

===== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* UI calling methods from the AddressBook class

There are various ways to cal the statistics methods from UI. Below are some options:

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Go through the calling flow of UI to logic to model.
** Pros: Abstraction principle is observed.
** Cons: More tedious for the developer to implement methods that UI requires.

* *Aternative 2:* Go through Model directly.
** Pros: Abstraction principle is violated.
** Cons: Less tedious to implement.

//end::memberselect[]

// tag::membersort[]

=== MemberSort

==== Current Implementation

The `memberSort` command extends from `MemberCommand`, and modifies the `uniquePersonList` which is an observable list. The user will provide a sorting criteria,
and the `memberSort` command will sort the members in the `uniquePersonList` based on the sorting criteria.

If the sorting criteria is not name, the `memberSort` command will
will conduct an additional sort (by name). For example, `memberSort yearOfStudy 2` will be sorted by member's yearOfStudy, followed by member's name.

.Sequence Diagram of MemberSortCommand
image::membersort_sequencediagram.png[width=70%]

* *Step 1:* The user executes the `memberSort` command by specifying the sorting criteria in which the user would like to sort the list.
* *Step 2:* The `memberSort` command will call `model#sortAddressBook` to retrieve the member's list.
* *Step 3:* Finally, the `memberSort` command will show a command success message to indicate that the member's list has been successfully sorted.

// end::membersort[]

// tag::memberexport[]
=== MemberExport

==== Current Implementation
.Sequence diagram for export function
image::MemberExportCommand_LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

* The `memberExport` command extends from command and retrieves the Person object from the Model based on the specified index

* The `exportPerson` command is called with the Person object being pass into the function as a parameter. The function will get the formatting as defined in resources/exportutil personInfo.html

* The formatted string in html mark up is then passed to the `exportDataToFile` function which then creates the file and writes to it.

* If the index specified in invalid, an error message will be displayed

* Currently the exported file is in html format. The formatted document is responsive to the screen size giving 2 options.

* For large screens (diagram below)

.Exported file on large screens
image::MemberExportExample.png[width="1000"]

* For smaller mobile screens (diagram below)

.Exported file on mobile screens
image::MemberExportExampleMobile.png[width="300"]

==== Future Implementation
* For future implementation, the `memberExport` would be able to take in an additional parameter for the selection of export format.
// end::memberexport[]


//tag::activity_list[]

=== Activity List Feature

One basic feature of `ClubManager` is to display and manage either a list of all the activities or some particular
activities that the club has. `activityAdd` , `activityList` , `activityFilter` , `activityFind` and
`activityDelete` commands contribute to this feature.

==== Current Implementation

[discrete]
===== Updated Model Component to Store Activity List
.Structure of the Activity Model Component
image::ModelComponentWithActivityList.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The updated `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Activity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Each activity can have a `List` of `MatricNumber` Object for attendance.

[discrete]
===== Activity Add Command
The `activityAdd` command enables users to create a new activity with name, datetime, location. User could
also provide additional description.

When user enters the command `activityAdd` in `Command Box`, the following sequence of events would occur:

Step 1. An `ActivityAddCommandParser` would be generated based on user's inputs. +
The presence of required prefixes and whether any prefixes are duplicated would be checked. +
Inputs would be checked in respective parser utils. +
If all checks pass, an `ActivityAddCommand` would be generated with the specified `Activity`.

Step 2. `ActivityAddCommand` would be executed by calling `ActivityAddCommand#execute` and it would attempt to
add the new `Activity` to `Model` by calling `Model#addActivity` +
Whether the `Activity` can be added to `Model` would be checked in this step.

.Sequence of Checks for Adding Activity
image::ActivityAddChecks.png[width="600" height="300"]


[discrete]
===== Activity Filter Command
The `activityFilter` command enables users to filter activities based on the time. Either past or
future activities would be filtered based on the condition in the user input.

The `activityFilter` mechanism is facilitated by `ActivityFilterCommand`, `ActivityFilterCommandParser`,
`ActivityDateTimeAfterPredicate` and `ActivityDateTimeBeforePredicate`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `ActivityFilterCommand` is carried out at each step.

Step 1. The users want to find all future `Activity` scheduled for the next seven days by inputting
`activityFilter + 7` in the command box.

Step 2. The `ActivityFilterCommandParser` will parse the input and generate an `ActivityDateTimeAfterPredicate`
based on the `+` condition given. The predicate will be passed to `ActivityFilterCommand`.

Step 3. The `ActivityFilterCommand` will call the `execute` function by executing `Model#updateFilteredActivityList`

Step 4. `AddressBook` will be committed due to potential update to `ActivityStatus` for each `Activity`.

The following diagram is a partial sequence diagram that summarises what happens when the user call
`ActivityFilterCommand` starting from `ActivityFilterCommandParser`.

.Activity Filter Command Sequence Diagram
image::ActivityFilterCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Activity Find Command
The `activityFind` command enables users to search for activities with specific keywords in some attribute
fields(i.e `ActivityName`, `ActivityDescription` and `ActivityLocation`).

The structure and sequence of events after `activityFind` command is called is very similar to that of
`activityFilter`. The one difference is, instead of generating a predicate based on conditions, the
`ActivityFindCommandParser` would parse the input into a `Map` of `Prefix` mapped to a `List` of `String`(keywords)
 and pass the map to generate an `ActivityContainsKeywordPredicate`.

To avoid redundancy and repeating diagrams with minor details, the sequence of events could refer to the steps and
sequence diagram for `ActivityFilterCommand` given above.

The key component of `ActivityFindCommand` is the `ActivityContainsKeywordsPredicate#test` function. The snippet
of code below is to show how it is implemented.

[source,java]
----
public boolean test(Activity activity) {
    // all attribute fields are searched.
    if (keywords.containsKey(PREFIX_ALL)) {
        return keywords.get(PREFIX_ALL).stream()
            .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(activity.getName().fullActivityName, keyword)
                || StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(activity.getDescription().value, keyword)
                || StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(activity.getLocation().value, keyword));
    }

     // OR search for a single boolean
   boolean isNameMatched = keywords.get(PREFIX_ACTIVITYNAME) == null
       || keywords.get(PREFIX_ACTIVITYNAME).stream()
           .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(activity.getName().fullActivityName, keyword));

   boolean isDescriptionMatched = keywords.get(PREFIX_ADESCRIPTION) == null
       || keywords.get(PREFIX_ADESCRIPTION).stream()
           .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(activity.getDescription().value, keyword));

   boolean isLocationMatched = keywords.get(PREFIX_LOCATION) == null
       || keywords.get(PREFIX_LOCATION).stream()
           .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(activity.getLocation().value, keyword));

   // AND search between prefixes
        return isNameMatched && isDescriptionMatched && isLocationMatched;
}
----

Here is some usage scenarios to better elucidate the logic of the predicate use:

* If a user want to find some `Activity` with name `Workshop` or `Outing`, it could be achieved by typing
`activityFind n/Workshop Outing`.
* If a user want to find some `Activity` with name `Movie` or `Viewing` and the location is a `cinema`,
`activityFind n/Movie Viewing l/cinema` could be used. +
`Activity` with `Movie Panel Discussion` as `ActivityName`, `Club Room` as `ActivityLocation` would not be displayed
by this command because it does not match the keyword provided by the location prefix.
* If no `Prexfix` is found, e.g. `activityFind Summer`, all `Activity` with `Summer` in any of the three
fields would be listed.

==== Design Considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current implementation of the activity list
feature.

===== Aspect: Updating the status of activities

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Loop through the entire `ActivityList` in `AddressBook` each time
the predicate to `FilteredActivityList` is updated.

** Pros: Ensures that all the status of `Activity` displayed by most command calls are accurate and every
`Activity` is in the sorted position whenever the list is displayed. The given code snippet below demonstrates
how this is achieved.
[source, java]
    //in ModelManager.java
    public void updateFilteredActivityList(Predicate<Activity> predicate) {
        requireNonNull(predicate);
        updateActivityList(); //loop through activitylist to update any outdated status
        filteredActivities.setPredicate(predicate);
    }
** Cons: The update function would be called for most activity commands, as it loops through the entire `ActivityList`,
it would make the app slower in performance. There may be unnecessary loops as well.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement an `activityUpdate` command and `ActivityStatus` would only be updated when
the command is called.

** Pros: Faster in performance.
** Cons: `ActivityStatus` displayed in the List may be outdated and the `Activity` might not be in the correct
sorted position.

===== Aspect: How to specify search field for `activityFind`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Search conditions are specified by `Prefix` such as `n/` for `ActivityName`
** Pros: Similar to other activity commands such as `activityAdd` or `activityEdit`. More accurate results.
** Cons: May be hard for new users to remember and understand the logic.

* **Alternative 2:** Use `name` etc. as search conditions.
** Pros: More intuitive for new users.
** Cons: Inconsistency with other activity commands. It may yield incorrect results as the app need to
distinguish whether an input is a keyword or a search condition.

// end::activity_list[]

//tag::activity_edit[]

=== Activity Edit Features

[discrete]
===== Activity Edit Command
`ClubManager` allows users to make changes to the information fields of activities that are currently in its activity list.

The `activityEdit` command allows users to edit the name, datetime, location and description fields of existing activities in the activity list.
At least one of the fields must be different from the existing record of the activity the user is trying to edit.

When the command is entered, an `ActivityEditCommandParser` is created with the inputs provided by the user. +
The ActivityEditCommandParser object would then validate the prefixes in the inputs and compare it with the current fields of the activity to check if there are any changes to be made. +
After that, the individual inputs would be validated in the parser utils. Finally, if the checks pass, an `ActivityEditCommand` object would be returned.

The execute command of the `ActivityEditCommand` object would then be called, and it will replace the existing Activity object (that the user wants to edit) with
a new Activity object created with the updated fields, and any other previous information if certain fields are not edited.

[discrete]
===== Activity Add Member Command
The `activityAddMember` command allows users to add members to the attendance list of an activity. The provided MatricNumber must be a valid MatricNumber and must belong to
a member in the member list.

When the `activityAddMember` command is executed from the UI, the inputs are parsed with the `ActivityAddMemberCommandParser` object which checks the validity of the MatricNumber.

If the inputs are valid, the `ActivityAddMemberCommand` is returned from the Parser object and the execute function is called. The first check would be if the provided activity
index number is valid, relative to the currently displayed activity list. Then, the Command object will check whether the MatricNumber belongs to a member in the member list. Finally,
it will check that the MatricNumber provided does not belong to a member already in the activity's attendance list.

If all the checks pass, the MatricNumber object containing the member's matric number will be stored in an ArrayList object(which represents the attendance list) belonging to the activity.

image::ActivityAddMember_ObjectDiagram.PNG[width="600" height="300"]


[discrete]
===== Activity Delete Member Command

The `activityDeleteMember` command allows users to remove members from the attendance list of an activity. The provided MatricNumber must be a valid MatricNumber and must belong to
a member in the member list.

When the `activityDeleteMember` command is executed from the UI, the inputs are parsed with the `ActivityDeleteMemberCommandParser` object which checks the validity of the MatricNumber.

If the inputs are valid, the `ActivityDeleteMemberCommand` is returned from the Parser object and the execute function is called. The first check would be if the provided activity
index number is valid, relative to the currently displayed activity list. Then, the Command object will check whether the MatricNumber belongs to a member in the member list. Finally,
it will check that the MatricNumber provided belongs to a member already in the activity's attendance list.

If all the checks pass, the MatricNumber object containing the member's matric number will be removed from the ArrayList object(which represents the attendance list) belonging to the activity.

// end::activity_edit[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// tag::implementationconfiguration[]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// end::implementationconfiguration[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/MemberFindCommand.java[`MemberFindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `MemberFindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.

==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

* Has necessary relevant features to a member management system
* Available in Desktop and Mobile Platforms.
* Easy to use and set up activities for members.

Cons:

* Does not clearly differentiate the Users application and the managers application well. This caused managers to download the users application.

* Interface could be more intuitive e.g. allowing preview of corporate members.

* No training document provided. Users have to contact the support manager for “how to” questions.
