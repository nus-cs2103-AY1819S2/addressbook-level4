This page aims to showcase my contribution to the project _In-Credit-Ble_ done in tandem with the software engineering
module (CS2103T). I will first give an introduction to _In-Credit-Ble_, followed by highlighting the key contributions
that i have made in the application. Lastly, I will be including the relevant sections of the User Guide(UG) and
Development Guide(DG) that I documented.

== PROJECT: In-Credit-Ble

== Overview

_In-Credit-Ble_ is a Finance Tracker created in order to assist fellow university students who have difficulty keeping
track of their daily expenses due to the multitude of micro-transactions that they encounter in their daily life. By
creating a finance tracker with an intuitive and easy-to-use User Interface (UI), we hope to help these students by
providing them with a hassle-free platform to manage their expenses.

_In-Credit-Ble_ was developed by a team of five students from the National University of Singapore
as part of a Software Engineering module (CS2103T). In a short span of 3 months, we understood the basic
structure of a software and adapted the source code of an address book into our finance tracker application.
I will be documenting my contributions to this project through the major and minor features implemented for
_In-Credit-Ble_.

== Summary of Contributions

|_This section will provide a summary of my contributions to In-Credit-Ble._

=== Features Enhancements

==== Major Enhancement: Implementation of the search feature

I added the ability to find records based on name, category or dates.

*What it does*: The `search` command allows the user to search for entries based on keyword that correspond to the
entries' name, category or date depending on the user's choice. The total sum of money spent on all the
filtered entries of the search is also displayed to allow user to know how much money he/ she has spent on a
particular type of transaction.

*Justification*: In the midst of numerous entries that the user has recorded in the application, this function will
allow the user to filter out certain transactions record that he/ she is interested in or wants to review.
Having the total sum of money spent on these records will allow the user to have a better understanding of his/ her
spending for a particular category, date or item.

*Highlights*: This enhancement can be triggered using the 'search' command. This feature is also expandable in
filtering out different kind of records by adding additional predicates in which the user can search with
(eg. Searching based on amount).

==== Minor Enhancement:
1. Introduced the function to add, edit or delete the `description` parameter of the entries using the already
implemented `edit` command.
** *What it does*: Allows user to make changes to the description of the any of the entries that he/ she has inputted
into _In-Credit-Ble_.
** *Justification*: This functionality allow the user to make any changes to the description easily, without having
the need to create a new entry. Furthermore, being able to delete the description will allow the user to remove
unnecessary information shown on the record card in _In-Credit-Ble_ so that he/ she can view his/ her transaction
easier.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement can be triggered using the `edit` command. In order to make changes to the description,
the user can add the necessary changes after the description prefix(`r/`). If the user wants to remove the description,
he/ she can input the description prefix with nothing after it.

2. Improved the `Spend` command to take in current date by default.
**  *What it does*: If the user does not key in the `date` field when using the `spend` command, the current date will
automatically be taken as the `date` instead.
** *Justification*: Since a transaction will usually be inputted into _In-Credit_Ble_ on the day of the transaction,
having this function allow the user to key in one less parameter when recording his/ her numerous transactions, making
it easier and enticing to record his/ her transactions.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement can be triggered using the `spend` command. Having this functionality will make
addition of entries easier and more accurate.

=== Other Notable Contributions:
* Enhancements to existing features:
** Updated the restrictions for `amount`, `date` to prevent the user from inputted an unwanted value for the
2 fields by accident. (Pull request: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main/pull/64[#68],
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main/pull/191[#191])
** Changed all instances of person to record when adapting the address book application to the finance tracker
   application. (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main/pull/58[#58])
** Wrote the automated tests for the `set` command and added additional tests for `allocate` command.
(Pull Request: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main/pull/194[#194])
* Documentation:
** Edited the user guide to ensure consistency between the application and the documentations. (Pull Request:
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main/pull/146[#146])
** Updated the application description in the ReadMe document so that users know what In-Credit-Ble is for.
(Pull Request: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main/pull/9[#9])

== Contributions to the User Guide
|===
|_This next section will include my contribution to the User Guide. This showcases my ability in documenting a
reader-friendly User Guide that is designed for new users of In-Credit-Ble to understand the different functionality
available in our application._
|===

I documented the `edit` and `search` command in the user guide. These portions highlight the functions,
usage and other relevant information about the 2 commands and is explained in ways that a new user will be able to
grasps.

=== 2) Description of Edit Command

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
|===
|_This last section will include my contribution to the Developer Guide. It showcases my ability in writing technical
documentation and also demonstrates the technical depth of my code contribution._
|===

=== Application Design
|===
|I constructed the class diagrams for the different components of the _In-Credit-Ble_ and explained the interaction
within these components. This will allow developers who wish to contribute to our project to easily understand how our
application is designed. Due to page constraints, I will only be showing the edits that I made to the `Logic`
and the `Model` component. To see the contributions I made in documenting the other components of the application,
please visit the links below.

=== Implementation of Search Command
|===
|I also documented the design of `Search` command to give the readers a better understanding of how the `search` command
is implemented and the interactions between the various components of the application in order for the `search` command
to be executed. I also listed the design considerations of the `search` command in order to explain why the current
implementation is chosen instead of the alternative.
