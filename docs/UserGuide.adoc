== Introduction

*Know-It-All* is a solution for those who find carrying physical flashcards around troublesome and prefer an application to help them store and organize their learning material. *Know-It-All*’s easy to use interface and digital storage allow users to effectively utilize intermittent breaks between lessons to cramp in that last bit of knowledge. *Know-It-All* is targeted at medicine students in NUS as their studies requires a considerable amount of memory work, and deals with content that is suitable for the bite-sized flashcard format.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `create f/FOLDER`, `FOLDER` is a parameter which can be used as `add f/Human Anatomy`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `i/INDEX [q/QUESTION] [a/ANSWER]` can be used as `i/1 q/Powerhouse of the cell a/Mitochondria` or as `i/1 q/Powerhouse of the cell`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` is also acceptable.
