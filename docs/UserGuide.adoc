Format: `list`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing candidate in Recruit Me. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [skill/TAG]... [position/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed(i.e adding of tags is not cumulative) except for

specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

// tag::filter[]
=== Clearing the filter in Recruit Me: `filter clear`
It clears all the filters in the applicant pool. +
Format: `filter clear`

=== Reversing the filter in Recruit Me: `filter reverse`
It reverses all the filtering conditions and show the eliminated ones. +
Format: `filter reverse`

=== Filtering Recruit Me: `filter`
It filters the current applicant pool regarding the existing entities of every single person (name, phone, email, address or skills). +
Format: `filter or/and [name<NAME>name] [phone<PHONE>phone] [email<EMAIL>email] [gpa<GPA>gpa] [edu<EDUCATION>edu] [addr<ADDRESS>addr] [skill<SKILL1, SKILL2, ... >skill][pos<POSITION1, POSITION2, ... >pos] [end<ENDORSEMENT>end]`

[TIP]
for every field, using `< or >` can cause false results. Please do not use them in filtering criterion texts. All the fields are optional but at least one field should be used

****
* For `GPA`, it prints the persons who have higher or equal amount of GPA from the given input
* For `ENDORSEMENT`, a positive integer value is wanted, it prints the persons who have that much or higher amount of endorsements.
* 'OR' Usage: According to the conditions written, if at least one of them passes with the regarding person in the applicant pool, the person is included in the filtered version.
* 'AND' Usage: According to the conditions written, if every single one of them passes with the regarding person in the applicant pool, the person is included in the filtered version.
* The filtering is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* If more than one skills are added to the filter, they should be separated by ','
* Filtering does not check if the written condition passes totally. It only checks, if the written condition is contained in the person properties.
e.g if there is someone named Alex, in the filtering conditions `n/ale/n` or `n/le/n` or `n/lex/n`, Alex will be included.
* All the people that are included in the filtering will be returned.
* All the operations, that change the content of the address book also clears every single filter.
* After one filtering, the filtered address book can be filtered again.
* For every single criteria between the filtering prefixes, input check for the validity is made

* Filtering is compatible with all the other commands:
** 1- clear : since the persons list changes, the filtering is automatically cleared
** 2- add : when filtering is active, adding a person also clears the filter along the addition. But addition takes place.
** 3- sort / select / delete / edit / list / undo / redo / help / exit / history : can be used without clearing the filter

****

Examples:

* filter or phone<91234567>phone email<johndoemail@example.com>email skill<C++, Java>skill end<2>end
** Returns the people, whose numbers include 91234567 or whose email includes johndoe@example.com or who has (contains) at least C++ or Java in the skills or has at least 2 endorsements.
* filter and name<ale>name addr<abcd>addr gpa<3.1>gpa skill<C++, Java>skill
** Returns the people, whose name contains ale and whose address contains abcd and who has (contains) C++ and Java both in the skills and has a GPA higher than or equal to 3.1

// end::filter[]

* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* All ASCII characters accepted, not limited to alphanumeric characters
* Error will be thrown if an employee tries to endorse a candidate more than once
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed (i.e adding of tags is not cumulative) except for
existing endorsement tags.
* Optional *clear* keyword will delete the employee endorsement at a specified index
* Error will be thrown if an employee tries to un-endorse a candidate he or she has not previously endorsed
* Compatible with filter and sorting methods for easy navigation

=== Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

****

Examples:

* `find John` +

=== Sorting persons: `sort`

Sorts persons by method described by the given keywords. +
Format: `sort [reverse] KEYWORD`

Accepted KEYWORDs:
        `name`; `surname`; `education`; `gpa`; `skills`; `positions`; `endorsements`; `skill number`;  +
        `position number`;  `endorsement number`

Examples:

* `sort education` +
Returns the persons, with new index numbers, in alphabetical order of their education.
* `sort reverse skills` +
Returns the persons, with new index numbers, in reverse alphabetical order of their first skill. Their first +
skill is that which appears first when the person's skills have been ordered alphabetically.

Methodology:
****
* The `sort name` command compares the Christian name first and then the surname. +
_e.g. `Adam Smith` shall come before `Shaun Adams` and `Adam Blacksmith` shall come before `Adam Smith`._
* The `sort surname` command compares the surname only. +
If two surnames match, then the previous relative ordering of the two shall be kept. +
_e.g. `Ben Adams` shall come before `Adam Black`._
* The `sort education` command sorts the persons by the alphabetical ordering of their education (case-insensitive). +
_e.g. `Charlotte Green (NTU)` shall come before `Adam Smith (NUS)`._
* The `sort gpa` command sorts the persons by increasing gpa numeric value. +
_e.g. `Adam Smith (3.1)` shall come before `Charlotte Green (3.9)`._
* The `sort skills` arranges each person's skills alphabetically and then arranges the people based on their skills in alphabetical order (case-insensitive). +
_e.g. `Peter Parker (Python, Debugging)` shall come before `Charlotte Oliveiro (Java)` +
since `Debugging` comes before `Java`._
* The `sort positions` arranges each person's positions alphabetically and then arranges the people based on their positions in alphabetical order. +
_e.g. `Charlotte Oliveiro (Project Consultant, Crime Analyst)` shall come before `Peter Parker (Databases)` +
since `Crime Analyst` comes before `Databases`._
* The `sort endorsements` arranges each person's endorsements alphabetically and then arranges the people based on their endorsements in alphabetical order (case-insensitive). +
_e.g. `Irfan Ibrahim (Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos)` shall come before `Alex Yeoh (Mark Cuban, Steve Jobs)` +
since `Jeff Bezos` comes before `Mark Cuban`._
* The `sort skill number` arranges persons based on the number of skills they have from most to fewest.+
_e.g. `Peter Parker (Python, Debugging)` shall come before `Charlotte Oliveiro (Java)` +
since `Peter Parker` has two skills where as `Charlotte Oliveiro` only has one._
* The `sort position number` arranges persons based on the number of positions they have from most to fewest.+
_e.g. `Charlotte Oliveiro (Project Consultant, Crime Analyst)` shall come before `Peter Parker (Databases)` +
since `Charlotte Oliveiro` has had two positions where as `Peter Parker` only has one._
* The `sort endorsement number` arranges persons based on the number of endorsements they have from most to fewest. +
_e.g. `Irfan Ibrahim (Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos)` shall come before `Bruce Wayne (Thomas Wayne)` +
since `Irfan Ibrahim` has two endorsements where as `Bruce Wayne` only has one._
* The `reverse` keyword can be used in conjunction with any of the above keywords and it shall reverse the ordering. +
_e.g. The `sort reverse surname` command shall result in `Adam Black` coming before `Ben Adams`._
* If the sorting method has two persons with the same value _(e.g. both persons have two endorsements in the 'sort +
endorsement number' command)_, then the previous relative ordering of the two shall be kept.
* The `sort` command is compatible with the `filter` command. +
If the Address Book contains ten persons, but the filter has selected just three persons, then only the three persons shall be ordered and returned with the new index numbers. +
Additional filters can be applied within the sort.
* The `sort` command is partially compatible with the `find` command. +
If the Address Book is currently sorted according to a certain method, the `find` command shall return the persons, according to the specified find keyword, ordered by the previous sort method. +
If the Address Book has currently _found_ certain persons from the `find` command, an additional sort shall sort all those in the address book and not just those that have been _found_.
Should the user wish to just sort a few people, the `filter` command should be used as outlined above.
* The `sort` command is compatible with all other commands (add/clear/delete/edit/exit/help/history/list/redo/select/undo). +
It shall not automatically update the returned list of persons. For example adding a person shall simply add them to the end of the list of persons.
****

=== Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
