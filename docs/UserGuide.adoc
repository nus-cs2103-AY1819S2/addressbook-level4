== Introduction

Welcome to the _MediTabs User Guide_! Over here, you can find step by step instructions on setting up MediTabs and learn ways to take advantage of the features provided to optimise your clinic's inventory management. Interested? You can jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== What is MediTabs?

MediTabs is a desktop application for managing medicine stock taking. Managing medicine can be time consuming and frustrating due to the overwhelming number of medicines in the market. Thus, MediTabs was created to provide pharmacist with a straightforward and efficient way to keep track of and maintain their inventory.

With MediTabs, medicine data is organized in a format that helps you quickly locate the information you need. MediTabs also sieves out and provides you with critical information such as which medicines are low in stock, expiring soon or have expired so that you can ensure your inventory is well maintained. Functionality to help you with tasks which require medicine data such as medicine labelling and inventory analysis is also provided, making MediTabs the only application you need for all things inventory related.

MediTabs supports Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems.

=== Who is it for?

If you are looking for a medicine stock taking application for clinics, MediTabs is the product for you. Whether you are an owner of a clinic or a pharmacist in charge of your clinic's medicine inventory, you can use MediTabs to help improve your workflow. It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MediTabs can get your medicine stock taking done faster than traditional GUI apps.

[[Features]]
== Features

As an inventory management application, MediTabs supports basic functionalities (add, edit, delete, list). On top of these basic functions, MediTabs also boasts several features tailored to your needs. These features aim to streamline your inventory management process, thereby enhancing your user experience.

// tag::informationpanelfeature[]
=== Information Panel
.Information panel
image::UserGuide_InformationPanel.png[width="700"]

Having a way to keep track of individual batches of medicine makes medicine management more efficient as problematic batches can easily be located and removed. However, with so many different batches of the same medicine, you need an effective way to organize them or it could get confusing.

The information panel provides all the details and information you need about each batch of medicine in a neat and organized manner.

You can easily refer to the batch table provided in the information panel while updating and managing your inventory. Simply select a medicine using the `select` command to view all its relevant details. You may refer to <<SelectCommand>> for more details.

You can also sort the table by any of its columns with the `sort` command to suit your needs and preference. You may refer to <<SortCommand>> for more details.
// end::informationpanelfeature[]

// tag::warningpanelfeature[]
=== Warning Panel

.Warning panel
image::UserGuide_WarningPanel.png[width="180"]

The warning panel provides an overview of pressing issues that have to be taken care of. With a quick glance, you will be able to identify expiring or expired batches of medicine, and medicines running low in stock.

On top of that, the warning panel features flexible thresholds that can be changed according your needs and preferences with a simple command, adding to your user experience.
// end::warningpanelfeature[]

You can learn about related commands related in <<WarningPanel>>.

// tag::exportingascsvfileformat[]
=== Exporting as CSV file format

You can export the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI as Comma-separated values (CSV) file format which is supported by many commonly used spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel (Windows), LibreOffice (Linux) or Numbers (macOS).

*Motivation* +
This feature is especially useful if you want to save the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI in a file so that it can be printed later or if you want to organise the medicine inventory data using a spreadsheet application for you, your superior or your supplier's reference.

In addition, you can even use the spreadsheet application to convert the CSV file to Microsoft Excel format and use all the functionalities provided by Microsoft Excel such as drawing graphs or chart to display the overview of your clinic's medicine inventory.

You can use the `export` command to take advantage of this feature. You can learn more about how to use the `export` command <<ExportCommand, here>>.
// end::exportingascsvfileformat[]

=== Coming in v2.0

Our team is constantly working to improve your user experience. Here are some features to look forward to in our next release.

==== Suggested medicine names

When typing fields that include medicine name, a list of suggested medicine names will appear after you input the first letter. +

[NOTE]
====
Press the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows to select from the generated list of suggestions.
====

// tag::inventoryforecasting[]
==== Inventory Forecasting

MediTabs will store information about your monthly stock level and predict the optimal amount of stock needed for the future. It will be possible to forecast inventory needs up to 3 months in advance with no extra effort from you as all analysis and calculations will take place with data already provided by routine use of MediTabs.
It will also be possible to import past inventory data to increase accuracy of forecasting immediately without having to wait for the application to collect data.

[NOTE]
Importing or allowing MediTabs to collect data for 6 months or more will produce a more accurate forecast.
// end::inventoryforecasting[]

// tag::integrationaddon[]
==== Integration Addon Support

You can download and install integration addons created for MediTabs such as addons which allows MediTabs to integrate with different third party services which your clinic might currently be using. +
Format: `install an/NAME_OF_ADDON`

[NOTE]
Only integration addons that have been verified by our team can be downloaded and installed in MediTabs. This is to ensure that the addons are secure and have no malicious code due to the increasing cybersecurity threat.

Benefits of integration addon support are as follows:

* Provides greater flexibility as as you might choose to integrate with different third-party services which are currently used by your clinic, to allow for easier transition between services.
* Allows you to customise MediTabs with features that your clinic requires without any unnecessary features which might not be relevant to your clinic's workflow.

An example of an integration addon which would be supported by MediTabs:

* Singapore's Health Sciences Authority (HSA) - To integrate the Singapore HSA's medical database with MediTabs which allows easy retrieval of important information such as when medicine is requested to be recalled by the HSA.

[NOTE]
This feature can be improved to support medical databases of different countries.
// end::integrationaddon[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
==== Encrypting data files

Due to the nature of medical inventories, the integrity of data stored is of utmost importance. The next release will feature data encryption to keep your inventory safe and keep unauthorised users away. With this feature, you will be required to log in with a password to view and edit your inventory. This feature can be disabled if it is not required for your needs.
// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::previewresults[]
==== Preview of results

Preview of results for Export and Label Commands to be available in the UI.

* Current implementation: You may have to manually search for the external files created in their respective folders. +

****
* The `FILE_NAME` field is optional. You can refer to <<Appendix A: File Naming Convention>> for supported file name format if you want to specify a file name for the exported CSV file.
* If no file name is specified, the `export` command uses the default file name format according to the date and time of export.
* The specific date and time format used if no file name is specified is `dd_MMM_yyyy_HH_mm_ss` e.g. `18_Mar_2019_10_28_00`
* The file extension for a CSV file is `.csv`

* If the default `exported` folder is not found in the home folder, MediTabs will automatically create the folder when the `export` command is executed.
****

[IMPORTANT]
Medicines without any batches are *not included* in the exported CSV file as they would not have any useful information such as the quantity and expiry dates which are important in the keeping track of your medicine inventory. This is by design, as our team believes that the exported CSV file should only provide *useful detailed information*.

Examples:

* `export` +
Exports the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI to a CSV file which has a default file name format `{Date of export}_{Time of export}`. e.g. `18_Mar_2019_10_28_00`
* `export example` +
Exports the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI to a CSV file which has the filename `example`.

[WARNING]
If a file with the specified file name already exists in the default `exported` folder, the file would not be exported and an error message `"Could not export data to csv file: {Specified File Name} already exists in "exported" directory"`

A sample image of how the medicine inventory data in the exported CSV file is organised:

.Sample of the exported CSV file
image::SampleCSVFileImage.png[width="790"]

[NOTE]
From the image above, you can observe that the exported CSV file only contains essential information such as the medicine batches, quantity and expiry date for each batch of medicine and which medicines are low in stock, expiring soon or have expired for easier reference.
// end::exportcommand[]

// tag::labelcommand[]
=== Printing labels : `label`

- You can label any specific medicine information in the inventory through the Portable Document Format (PDF). +
Open the PDF file under the PDF folder to view and print your selected medicine. +
- Label will include name of medicine and standard label template. +
This includes the company that manufactured it, expiry date and the tags that was set with it. +
- Your format for using the command should follow: `label INDEX [f/FILE_NAME]`
- File name is optional.
****
* Outputs the label for the medicine at the specified INDEX.
* If no file name is specified, the default file name is `to_print`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed medicine list.

MediTabs uses the following file naming convention when file name field is used e.g. The `export` command's optional `[FILE_NAME]` field. The file naming convention is to ensure consistency and to avoid potential bugs involving file names with different operating systems such as Windows, Linux and macOS +
Format: `Start with an alphabet or number followed by alphabets, numbers, underscore or hyphen`

[NOTE]
File name *does not* include file extension such as `.csv` and `.pdf`. You do not have to include file extension when specifying the file name field such as in `export [FILE_NAME]`. MediTabs will handle the file name extension for you.

Examples of correct and incorrect file names:
|===
|Correct |Incorrect

|`myMedicalData`
|`_myMedicalData`

|`my_Medical_Data`
|`my Medical Data`

|`myMedicalData1`
|`myMedicalData.txt`

|`1myMedicalData`
|`-MyMedicalData`
|===

[IMPORTANT]
You must follow the file naming convention format when specifying the file name field for any commands that support file name as a field.

[CAUTION]
The characters of the file name cannot contain any spacing or symbols, including but not limited to, `\/:*?"<>|.+[]{};!@#$%^&~`` Reserved names, indicated in Windows documentation, are also *not allowed* to be used as file names such as `COM1` and `LPT8`. The reserved names are *case insensitive* for example, `com1` or `CoM1` are also reserved names. You can read more about file naming conventions in Windows link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file#naming-conventions[here].
