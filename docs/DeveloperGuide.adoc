By: `Team CS2103-AY1819S2-W16-2`      Since: `Mar 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product, you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PinListPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `ArchiveListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

// tag::modelcomponent[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book, Archive Book and Pin Book data as 3 separate instances of the AddressBook class.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Property` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Property` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::modelcomponent[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Archive Book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pin Book data in json format and read it back.
* maintains separate data files for each of the books.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::modeltransformation[]
=== Transformation of AddressBook4 to The Real App
==== Current Implementation

To allow *The Real App* to store client contact and property information, the model of *AB4* must be modified.
The `Person` class has been modified to only contain the following 4 information: +

* `Name` -- Encapsulates the name of a client in the model.
* `Phone` -- Encapsulates the phone of a client in the model.
* `Email` -- Encapsulates the email of a client in the model.
* `Remark` -- Encapsulates the remark associated with a client in the model.

The `Person` class has also been extended to the following 4 sub-classes to encapsulate the customer type and related information: +

* `Buyer` -- Represents a client who is a buyer in the model.
* `Seller` -- Represents a client who is a seller in the model, contains additional property information.
* `Tenant` -- Represents a client who is a tenant in the model.
* `Landlord` -- Represents a client who is a landlord in the model, contains additional property information.

The abstraction of the property information is done through a `Property` class. The `Property` class encapsulates property information through the following 3 classes:

* `Address` -- Encapsulates the address of a property in the model.
* `Price` -- Encapsulates the price of a property in the model.
* `Tag` -- Encapsulates short keywords associated with a property in the model.

There are 2 ways through which client information can be added into the model. One is through user input in the `add` command, the other is through reading the storage json files at launch. +

Given below is an example scenario of how client information can be added into the model via the 2 ways described above. +

*From storage*

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. `MainApp` will find the `addressbook`, `archivebook` and `pinbook` json files in the data folder and get them as `JsonAddressBookStorage` objects.

Step 3. The `JsonAddressBookStorage` objects are used to initialise `StorageManager`.

Step 4. The `MainApp` calls `initModelManager` method which will eventually return a `ModelManager` object.

Step 5. To build the model, the `StorageManager` will build three `AddressBook` objects which are collections of all the `Person` objects stored in the `addressbook`, `archivebook` and `pinbook` json files.

Step 6. The three `AddressBook` objects are used to initialise the `ModelManager`, which creates the model.

The following sequence diagram summarizes how the model is created from json files when a user launches The Real App:

image::LaunchSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Through add command*

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user enters the `add` command with the correct parameters into the Command Box. +
e.g. `add c/seller n/James Tan p/97652456 e/jamestan@example.com r/need to sell by April 2018 a/Blk 345 Clementi Ave 5, #04-04, S120345 sp/500000 t/MRT t/newlyRenovated`

Step 3. The `LogicManager` handles the user input and creates an `AddCommand` object.

Step 4. The `AddCommand` object is executed by the `LogicManager`.

Step 5. The `ModelManager` updates the model to add the contact into the `AddressBook`.

The following sequence diagram summarizes how a contact is added to the `AddressBook` using the `add` command:

image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Other Improvements

To allow for modification and retrieval of information, the `edit` and `search` commands have been expanded to fit the new model.

**Edit command**

Edit command has been improved to handle the different types of contacts safely.
Object type checking is done during the execution of the command to ensure that only the correct information associated with the customer type is edited. This also ensures that the returned object is the same class as the original object being edited.

**Search command**

The original `find` command in AB4 has been renamed to `search` command to better reflect its new functionality. `search` command can now search through multiple information fields to look for matches to the input keywords.
This allows users to quickly retrieve contacts using whatever limited information they may have at hand.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Abstraction of different customer types

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The four customer types are abstracted as sub-classes which extends the `Person` class
** Pros: Allows for subclass polymorphism.
** Cons: Legacy code from AB4 is not optimised for runtime polymorphism.
* **Alternative 2:** Encapsulate customer type information in `Person` class using a `CustomerType` class.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Requires rigorous checking of customer type to ensure each contact is handled appropriately.
* **Alternative 3:** Refactor `Person` class into an abstract class and extend the 4 subclasses from it
** Pros: Prevents the initialisation of a `Person` object, which is not required in our application.
** Cons: Much of the legacy code of AB4 has strong dependence on the instantiation of the `Person` objects.
// end::modeltransformation[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

[NOTE]
The archiveBook and pinBook use the VersionedAddressBook as well to facilitate the undo/redo mechanism by running in parallel with addressBook.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::pinunpinfeatures[]
=== Pin/Unpin feature

This feature allows users to move person between contact list and pin list. To use this feature, the user need to enter `pin` or `unpin` command, with the `INDEX`(in the contact list and pin list) of the contact to be pinned/unpinned.

* `pin 2`

The command above put the 2nd contact in the contact list to the topped pin list.

* `unpin 1`

The command above put the 1st contact in the pin list back to the contact list.


What's more, it also allow users to select some contact in the pin list and display address location on the Google Maps(TM) browser window. To use this feature, the users need to enter `pinselect` command, with the `INDEX`(in the pin list) of the contact to be selected.

* `pinselect 3`

The command above will select the 3rd contact in the pin list and the address location is displayed on the Google maps(TM) browser window.

==== Current Implementation
This section explains the implementation of all pin related features.

===== Pin/Unpin
The following sequence diagram shows how the pin operation works:

image::PinUnpinSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

* The command is recognized by `parserCommand()` and an `PinCommandParser` is created, then a `PinCommand` object is created with the parsed index.

* The command object is then executed by `Logic` and `pinPerson` is called from the `PinCommand` object. Then `pinPerson` will call `ModelManager` to create two `VersionedAddressBook` object: `versionedPinBook` and `versionedAddressBook`.

* The `versionedPinBook` call `addPerson()` and the `versionedAddressBook` call `removePerson()`.

* Both objects will call `commit()` after execution.

The `unpin` command does the opposite -- it calls `removePerson()` of the `versionedPinBook` and `addPerson()` of the `versionedAddressBook` instead.

===== PinSelect

The `pinselect` command is implemented the same as `select`.

When `pin` and `unpin` are performed, the pinned/unpinned contact is being selected automatically.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How pin & unpin executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book and pin book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Commands excepts `pin`, `unpin`, `pinselect` command doesn't work on the pinned person.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Users must filter pin list contacts' information through eyes.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book and pin book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
// end::pinunpinfeatures[]

// tag::archive[]
=== Archive features

==== Current Implementation

This section explains the implementation of all archive related features.

To implement the archive features, an `archiveBook` is created in the `Model` and `Storage` to facilitate the archiving of contacts. The `archiveBook` implements the `AddressBook` class in the `Model` since it works similarly, and has its own `ArchiveBookStorage` class in the `Storage` to facilitate the storage of a separate data file.

===== Archive/Unarchive

The following sequence diagram shows how the `archive` command operation works:

image::ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `unarchive` command does the opposite -- it calls `addPerson(p)` of the `versionedAddressBook` and `removePerson(p)` of the `versionedArchiveBook` instead.

===== Archive List

The `archivelist` command displays the list of persons in the `archiveBook`. This has to be carefully implemented to work hand-in-hand with the list of persons in the `addressBook`, as well as the `list` command.

More importantly, to have a separate archive list that can be swapped back and forth with the main list in the UI display requires careful designs and implementations in the `Logic` and `Ui` components.

===== Archive Select

The `archiveselect` command is implemented the same as 'select'.

When `unarchive` is performed on a person that has been selected by `archiveselect`, `archiveselect` is set to be `null`, so no person will be selected.

===== Archive Clear
The `archiveclear` command is implemented the same as `clear` where a new empty `archiveBook` is created by calling `Model#setArchiveBook(new AddressBook())`.

==== Design Considerations
// end::archive[]

// tag::select[]
=== Select feature

==== Current Implementation

The select feature requires careful implementation:

* As there are 3 separate lists (main contact list, archive list, pin list) that can be selected from, having a unique command for each list (i.e. `select`, `archiveselect`, `pinselect`) ensures that the person is selected from the correct list.

* Only at most 1 person can be selected at any point in time from each list.
** However, having 3 separate lists means that there will be overlapping selections which will cause errors in the `Ui` component in displaying the browser panel.
** To avoid overlapping of selections from each of the select commands, previous selections from another list are set to null.

* Adding and editing a person will select that person.

* Deleting, archiving and unarchiving a selected contact will set the selection to null.

* Changing lists will set the selected person in the list that is swapped away to be set to null.

* Selection of a pinned person will remain regardless of which of the two lists are displayed.

// end::select[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, The Real App depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
