== About PocketProject

PocketProject is a project developed by my team and I as part of our Software Engineering Project. Our team decided to morph the original codebase given to us into a project management plus employee management software to help software engineering project managers keep track of their projects and employees. In particular, some notable features PocketProject provides includes recording of milestones, user stories, employees information as well as a statistics feature for managers.

== Summary of contributions

This section contains a summary of my various contributions to the project, ranging from coding to documentation and other helpful contributions I made.

* *A feature I developed*: The ability to manage *user stories in a project*.
** What it does: This feature is supported by several commands, which allows a user to add and remove user stories from a project. In addition, a user can also update the progress status of a user story, as well as edit the details of a user story.
** Why its important: User stories are integral to projects and thus its important to be able to record and keep track of them. Being able to see the progress of different user stories can give a good gauge of the progression of the whole project and whether its on track, as well as allow prioritisation of different enhancements to prioritise based on how important the user story is.
** Highlights: This enhancement makes use of a unique parsing method which allows users to be able to be flexible in entering input yet allow proper processing of the input to be able to show up elegantly on the UI. In addition, it arranges the user stories by order of their importance for ease of readability.
