== PROJECT: HMS+

== Overview

HMS+ is a hotel management system made for hotels to manage their customers and their relevant transactions.
The hotel staff interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and has around 15k LOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the complete UI except statistics
** What it does: It allows all the useful information to be visualised in a clear and user friendly way.
** Justification: The UI connects the user and the machine and making it simple for the user to use all our functions.
** Highlights: This enhancement required understanding of the whole codebase as the UI need to bring different parts
together to make the application easy to use.
I need to know what functions and features we have and how we want the user to use it so that I can implement the UI in a user friendly way.
** Credits: I mainly used the concepts from the existing codebase and those that were taught in CS2103T to implement my features.
** Feature:

* *Minor enhancements*:

** https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/pull/173[Find booking command implementation]
** What it does: It allows all the user to find bookings according to its service type, time range and customer id.
** Justification: This enables the user to check the bookings efficiently.
** Highlights: This enhancement required understanding of the whole codebase as the UI need to bring different parts
together to make the application easy to use.

=== UI component

// tag::ui-diagram[]
.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width:"1200"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/hms/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]
// end::ui-diagram[]
The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`StatsWindow`, `HelpWindow`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/hms/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

==== How the UI executes commands
This is handled by function `executeCommand` defined in MainWindow.
The function `executeCommand` will be passed in `CommandBox` as a functional interface `CommandExecutor` which is defined in `CommandBox`.
When adding text in `CommandBox` and pressed `Enter`, the command text will be passed to `Logic` component and be parsed and executed.

===== How the UI automatically filter by selected service type
This is handled by the listener for selected serviceType/roomType inside the booking/reservation list panel.
If the selected one is changed, the booking/reservation list panel will run a find command so that the list will be updated accordingly.

===== How the UI automatically switch tab
The BookingAndReservationPanel and ServiceTypeAndRoomType panel are numbered as 1 and 2. And the tabs inside them are numbered accordingly also.
To switch to a certain tab, we need to specify which tab in which panel we want to go. There are two listeners for the two panel.
If the selected tab is changed, the panel will switch accordingly. The selected tab can be changed by click and switch command.
The selected tab will also be changed accordingly if the command executed is a `ReservationCommand` or a `BookingCommand`.

=== Filtering service booking functionality
==== Current Implementation

To find and filter the service bookings, we need to work on Logic, Model and Storage components. We can start
on the Logic component. According to the current implementation, a command can only take in one model -- either
a customer model or a booking model. Limited by this, we cannot get access to customer list and booking list at the
same time in one command. To implement the function without changing the base abstraction, we used identification number
to check whether the payer of the booking is the customer we are selecting instead of using the index of a customer.
The reason we use identification number(ID) instead of name or other factors is that the ID of one customer is unique.

The `FindBookingCommand` involves the use of multiple components of the HMS+ application. The figure below shows the
high level [underline]#Sequence Diagram# for the `FindBookingCommand`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How should the customer be stressed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using identification number(ID) to check.
** Pros: The command can be implemented as only getting access to one model.
** Cons: The scalability of the program is low.
* **Alternative 2:** Implementing new command interface which can interact with two models at the same time.
** Pros: The scalability of the program is high
** Cons: Requiring more work and the old abstraction may break.


== Achievements and Learning Outcomes

* Work on a large code base in a team
* Learned how to design UI in a user friendly way
