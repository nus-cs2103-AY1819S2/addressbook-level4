== PROJECT: The Infinity Machine

---

== Overview

The Infinity Machine is a desktop application that lets users store research materials for future use. It provides a quick and easy way for tech-savvy users, like university students or researchers, to manage and organise their research materials.

The user interacts with the application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancement*: Added bibliography related functionalites
** What it does: This set of functionalities allows the sources stored in the Infinity Machine to be used for generating bibliographical entries in the APA or MLA style.
** Justification: A typical user would expect a piece of software for managing sources to also be able to generate appropriate bibliography entries.
** Implementation: This new feature required a large number of additional fields in source. A new command, biblioEdit, was added to manage these fields.
