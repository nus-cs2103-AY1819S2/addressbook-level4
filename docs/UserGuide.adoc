== Introduction

GradTrak is an application designed for NUS students to easily track their graduation progress. It is currently only limited to courses offered in School of Computing. The primary method of input is Command Line Interface (CLI) which will benefit students of SoC as they generally type quickly. Proceed to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `GradTrak.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Module Plan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`update`* : retrieves the latest information of all modules from CORS.
* **`add`**`c/cs1010 s/y1s1 g/A` : adds the module "CS1010", taken in Y1S1 with grade A, into the list of completed modules.
* **`delete`**`1` : deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add c/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/cs1010`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `c/MODULE_CODE [g/GRADE_OBTAINED]` can be used as `c/cs1010 g/A` or as `c/cs1010`.
