== Introduction

Welcome to *TravelBuddy's* Developer Guide, put together by Chung Ming, Prem, Niven and Shaun. In this guide, you will find all the relevant information to get you familiarize with TravelBuddy's design and implementation.

== Setting Up

Before we begin, here is a quick guide on how you can set up your machine to optimize the performance of TravelBuddy.

=== Prerequisites

There are two installations that you need to take note of. They are:

* *Install JDK version `9` or later*
+
[WARNING]
For Windows developers, <<jdk, Java>> version `10` will fail to run tests in headless mode due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug]. Therefore, we strongly encourage all Windows developers to stick with JDK version `9`.

* *Install IntelliJ IDE*
[NOTE]
By default, <<ide, IntelliJ>> already has both Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. As TravelBuddy will be making use of them, please do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting Up the Project in Your Computer

For this section, we will integrate JDK, IntelliJ and GitHub with TravelBuddy, before compiling it using Gradle. The steps are listed below:

. Go to this repo, fork it first before cloning it. Fork it again to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/travel/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/travel/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the Setup

. Run the `seedu.travel.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do Before Writing Code

==== Configuring the Coding Style

This project follows the https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[OSS-Generic Java Coding Standard]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting Up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

This section provides a high-level overview of overall architecture of TravelBuddy,
including the design and structure of components and their constituent classes.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

[[ArchitectureDiagram]]
[reftext="Figure 3.1.1"]
[caption="Figure 3.1.1: "]
.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

<<ArchitectureDiagram>> above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/travel/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component, as seen in the class diagram in <<LogicClassDiagram>>, defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The sequence diagram, as seen in <<SeqDiagramDforDeletePlace>>, below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

[[SeqDiagramDforDeletePlace]]
[reftext="Figure 3.1.3"]
[caption="Figure 3.1.3: "]
.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePlace.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

[[UiClassDiagram]]
[reftext="Figure 3.2.1"]
[caption="Figure 3.2.1: "]
.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `UI` component, as seen in <<UiClassDiagram>>, uses JavaFx UI framework. The *layout* of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/travel/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The 'UI' component *controllers* are found in the `src/main/java/seedu/travel/ui` folder. Each class corresponds to a specific `.fxml` file.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of various parts specified below.
All parts inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

*Brief overview* of each UI Component:

`MainWindow`: Consists of the main menu with `File` and `Help` dropdowns and the remaining UI parts below.

* `HelpWindow`: Webview to display UserGuide.html

* `CommandBox`: Directly below the main menu, CLI displayed here

* `ResultDisplay`: Displays CLI feedback to user, (eg. `Unknown command`, `Invalid command format!`)

* `StatusBarFooter`: At the bottom of MainWindow, reports the status of the TravelBudy application

* `PlaceListPanel`: On the left of BrowserPanel, displays Places as a VBox of PlaceListCards

** `PlaceListCard`: Labels for the Display index and Place data fields (CountryCode, Rating etc.) in a VBox the left,
Labels that display Name and actual Place data (CountryCode, Rating etc) in a VBox on the right.

* RightParentPanel: Parent panel for both `DisplayListPanel` and `ExtendedPlacePanel`,
contains helper methods for switching functionality, interacts with model and logic

** `DisplayListPanel`: Parent panel for analytics of all Places, the `generate` command displays this panel

*** `DisplayCard`: Displays `Chart` data in a bar graph

** `ExtendedPlacePanel`: Display an expanded view of all Place data. Photo attachments to be included here as well in future releases (beyond v1.4).

* `BrowserPanel`: *_Deprecated._* Opens on clicking the PlaceListCard, on the right of the PlaceListPanel.

*All CSS code can be found in `DarkTheme.css` and `Extensions.css`

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
[reftext="Figure 3.3.1"]
[caption="Figure 3.3.1: "]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/travel/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TravelBuddyParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a place).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given in <<DeletePersonSdForLogic>> below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

[caption="Figure 3.3.2: "]
.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

[[ModelClassDiagram]]
[reftext="Figure 3.4.1"]
[caption="Figure 3.4.1: "]
.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/travel/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the place data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Place>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `TravelBuddy`, which `Place` can reference. This would allow `TravelBuddy` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Place` needing their own `Tag` object. An
 example of how such a model may look like is seen in <<ModelClassBetterOopDiagram>>. +
 +
[[ModelClassBetterOopDiagram]]
[reftext="Figure 3.4.2"]
[caption="Figure 3.4.2: "]
.OOP Class Diagram
image::ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

[[StorageClassDiagram]]
[reftext="Figure 3.5.1"]
[caption="Figure 3.5.1: "]
.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/travel/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the TravelBuddy data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.travel.commons` package.

// tag::implementation[]
== Implementation
// end::implementation[]

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Feature

Called by the `undo` and `redo` commands to undo and redo changes to TravelBuddy Place entries.
Undoable commands include `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `deletem`, `clear`, `generate` and `redo`. Redoable commands include `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `deletem`, `clear`, `generate` and `undo`.

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTravelBuddy`.
It extends `TravelBuddy` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `travelBuddyStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTravelBuddy#commit()` -- Saves the current TravelBuddy state in its history.
* `VersionedTravelBuddy#undo()` -- Restores the previous TravelBuddy state from its history.
* `VersionedTravelBuddy#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone TravelBuddy state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTravelBuddy()`, `Model#undoTravelBuddy()` and `Model#redoTravelBuddy()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTravelBuddy` will be initialized with the initial TravelBuddy state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single TravelBuddy state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th place in TravelBuddy. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitTravelBuddy()`, causing the modified state of TravelBuddy after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `travelBuddyStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted TravelBuddy state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new place. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitTravelBuddy()
`, causing another modified TravelBuddy state to be saved into the `travelBuddyStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTravelBuddy()`, so the TravelBuddy state will not be saved into the `travelBuddyStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the place was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTravelBuddy()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous TravelBuddy state, and restores the TravelBuddy to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial TravelBuddy state, then there are no previous TravelBuddy states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTravelBuddy()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoTravelBuddy()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores TravelBuddy to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `travelBuddyStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest TravelBuddy state, then there are no undone TravelBuddy states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTravelBuddy()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify TravelBuddy, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitTravelBuddy()`, `Model#undoTravelBuddy()` or `Model#redoTravelBuddy()`. Thus, the `travelBuddyStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitTravelBuddy()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `travelBuddyStateList`, all TravelBuddy states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire TravelBuddy.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the place being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of TravelBuddy states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedTravelBuddy`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::search[]
=== Search Feature
==== Current Implementation

The `search` command provides functionality for users to search for places in TravelBuddy that contains the specified input.
The user's input is split in separate keywords and matched as a `Predicate` to the list of places in TravelBuddy.
Places with matching keywords will be displayed on the GUI, which allows users to retrieve a list of places according to their input.

*Logic:* The `search` mechanism is executed by `SearchCommand`, which extends from `Command`. A code snippet is shown below:

[source, java]
public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) {
    requireNonNull(model);
    model.updateFilteredPlaceList(predicate);
    return new CommandResult(constructFeedbackToUser(model));
}

<<Figure 4.2.1.1>> below shows the class diagram of the `search` mechanism and its associations with the other class in the Logic component.

[[SearchCommandClassDiagram]]
.Class Diagram for `search` command.
image::SearchCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.1: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.1"]


The example below is a usage scenario for the search feature and is based on the search name feature.
[NOTE]
The various search features (i.e. search name, country code, rating, tags, year) function on a similar concept, differing only in the `Parser` which is called using different command words and the `Predicate` to filter arguments.

The following sequence diagram, <<Figure 4.2.1.2>>, shows how the search feature works:

[[SearchCommandSequenceDiagram]]
.Sequence Diagram for `search` command.
image::SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.2: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.2"]

The control flow of the sequence diagram above is as follows:

. Initially, a user enters a command with the command word `search` followed by argument(s).
. `LogicManager` receives the `execute` command and calls the `parseCommand` method in `TravelBuddyParser`.
. `TravelBuddyParser` parses `search` as the command and a `SearchCommandParser` will be instantiated to further parse the command.
. `SearchCommandParser` receives the arguments if the command word input matches the command word of any search command.

** The argument string is split into an array of keywords based on the `regex` which is `\\s+` in the code snippet below.
+
[source, java]
String[] nameKeywords = trimmedArgs.split("\\s+");
return new SearchCommand(new NameContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(nameKeywords)));
** A NameContainsKeywordPredicate will be instantiated with the array of arguments as the predicate, which will be used to check if any of the places in TravelBuddy matches the user's input.
+
[source, java]
public boolean test(Place place) {
    return keywords.stream().anyMatch(
        keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(
        place.getName().fullName, keyword));
}
. Subsequently, `SearchCommandParser` creates a `SearchCommand` object with the predicate and returns it to `LogicManager`.
. Following that, `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of `SearchCommand`, shown in the code snippet below.
+
[source, java]
public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) {
    requireNonNull(model);
    model.updateFilteredPlaceList(predicate);
    return new CommandResult(constructFeedbackToUser(model));
}
. `SearchCommand` updates the list in `Model`, which will be displayed in the GUI.
. `SearchCommand` instantiates a `CommandResult` object and passes it to `LogicManager` .

The search feature comprises of:

* `Search by Name`
* `Search by Rating`
* `Search by Tags`
* `Search by Country`
* `Search by Year`


===== Search Name Feature
The command word for search name is `search` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchCommandParser`.

The name arguments entered by the user are stored in a list of keywords and passed into `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where the list is converted into a stream and individually matched to the names of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search name mechanism is facilitated by `SearchCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the name of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.3>> below.

[[UIsearch]]
.GUI with user's list of places, prior to running `search Singapore` command.
image::UIsearch.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.3: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.3"]

Step 2. The user executes `search Singapore` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `Singapore` in its name.
The user input will be passed into `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses `TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since the argument is `search`, `SearchCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called to parse the arguments to be used in `SearchCommand`.
The parsed arguments will be used as a predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

[NOTE]
The command `search` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.4>> below.

[[UIsearchresults]]
.Application Interface displaying the results of `search Singapore` command.
image::UIsearchresults.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.4: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.4"]

===== Search Rating Feature
The command word for search rating is `searchr` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchRatingCommandParser`.

The rating arguments entered by the user are first checked for validity before being stored in a list of keywords and passed into `RatingContainsKeywordsPredicate`. The list is then converted into a stream and individually matched to the rating of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search rating mechanism is facilitated by `SearchRatingCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the rating of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search rating mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.5>> below.

[[UIsearchrating]]
.GUI with user's list of places, prior to running `searchr 4` command.
image::UIsearchrating.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.5: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.5"]

Step 2. The user executes `searchr 4` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `4` as its rating.
The user input will be passed into `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses `TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since
the argument is `searchr`, `SearchRatingCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called to parse the arguments to be
used in `SearchRatingCommand`. The arguments are checked for validity (i.e. rating value between 1 to 5) as seen in the code snippet below before being parsed.

[source, java]
String[] ratingKeywords = trimmedArgs.split("\\s+");
for (String rating : ratingKeywords) {
    if (!Rating.isValidRating(rating)) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(Rating.MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS,
             SearchRatingCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }
}
return new SearchRatingCommand(new RatingContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(ratingKeywords)));

The parsed arguments will be used as a predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

[NOTE]
The command `searchr` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

[NOTE]
The arguments for `searchr` range from 1 to 5. Non-integer values outside the range are not recognised by the application.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.6>> below.

[[UIsearchratingresults]]
.Application Interface displaying the results of `searchr 4` command.
image::UIsearchratingresults.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.6: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.6"]

===== Search Tags Feature
The command word for search tags is `searcht` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchTagsCommandParser`.

The tags arguments entered by the user are stored in a list of keywords and passed into `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where the list is converted into a stream and individually matched to the tags of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search tags mechanism is facilitated by `SearchTagsCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the tags of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search tags mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.7>> below.

[[UIsearchtags]]
.GUI with user's list of places, prior to running `searcht distillery` command.
image::UIsearchtags.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.7: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.7"]

Step 2. The user executes `searcht distillery` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `distillery`
as its tag. The user input will be passed into `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses
`TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since the argument is `searcht`, `SearchTagsCommandParser#parse(arguments)`
will be called to parse the arguments to be used in `SearchTagsCommand`. The parsed arguments will be used as a
predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

[NOTE]
The command `searcht` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.8>> below.

[[UIsearchtagsresults]]
.Application Interface displaying the results of `searcht distillery` command.
image::UIsearchtagsresults.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.8: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.8"]

===== Search Country Feature
The command word for search country is `searchc` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchCountryCommandParser`.

The country code arguments entered by the user are stored in a list of keywords and passed into `CountryCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where the list is converted into a stream and individually matched to the country code of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search country mechanism is facilitated by `SearchCountryCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the country code of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search country mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.9>> below.

[[UIsearchcountry]]

Step 2. The user executes `searchc SGP JPN` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `SGP` or `JPN`
as its country. The `searchc` command will call `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses
`TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since the argument is `searchc`, `SearchCountryCommandParser#parse(arguments)`
will be called to parse the arguments to be used in `SearchCountryCommand`. The arguments are then checked for validity (i.e. valid ISO-3166 country code).
The parsed arguments will be used as a predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

[NOTE]
The command `searchc` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

[NOTE]
The country code arguments for `searchc` must be valid 3-letter ISO-3166 country codes.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.10>> below.

.Application Interface displaying the results of `searchc JPN` command.
image::UIsearchcountryresults.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.10: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.10"]

===== Search Year Feature
The command word for search year is `searchyear` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchYearCommandParser`.

The year arguments entered by the user are stored in a list of keywords and passed into `YearContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where the list is converted into a stream and individually matched to the year of visit of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search year mechanism is facilitated by `SearchYearCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the year of visit of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search year mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.11>> below.

[[UIsearchyear]]
.GUI with user's list of places, prior to running `searchyear 2016` command.
[#img-UIsearchyear]
image::UIsearchyear.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.2.1.11: ", reftext="Figure 4.2.1.11"]

Step 2. The user executes `searchyear 2016` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `2016`
as its year visited. The `searchyear` command will call `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses
`TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since the argument is `searchyear`, `SearchYearCommandParser#parse(arguments)`
will be called to parse the arguments to be used in `SearchYearCommand`. The arguments are then checked for validity (i.e. valid year from 1900 to the current year).
The parsed arguments will be used as a predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

[NOTE]
The command `searchyear` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

[NOTE]
The year arguments range from 1900 to the current year. A single year, multiple years or a range of years can be passed in as arguments.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input as shown in <<Figure 4.2.1.12>> below.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How search executes
[width="100%",cols="16%,<50%,<50%",options="header"]
|=======================================================================

|
|*Alternative 1 (current choice)*
|*Alternative 2*

|*Description*
|Matches entire keyword.
|Remove whitespaces and check if the place contains the argument string.

|*Pros*
|*Speed*: This approach is faster in processing speed and computationally less intensive. +
*Refined results*: This approach provides more refined results as it narrows down the search scope to only what the user needs.

|*Flexibility*: This approach supports a search for partial keywords, so that users do not have to type the full keyword.

|*Cons*
|*Inflexible*: This approach is unable to support a search for partial keywords and may prove to be restrictive for certain users.
|*Wide range of results*. This approach provides a wider range of results, which may devolve into a messy clutter if the keyword is too general, defeating the purpose of filtering the list through search.
|=======================================================================

*Decision*: Alternative 1 of matching the entire keyword is adopted as it reduces processing time during keyword matching.
In addition, it narrows down the search options by only returning keywords that matches the search query, which is the main objective of implementing a search feature.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support search commands
[width="100%",cols="16%,<50%,<50%",options="header"]
|=======================================================================

|
|*Alternative 1 (current choice)*
|*Alternative 2*

|*Description*
|Use a list to store the user input keywords and places.
|Use `HashMap` to map keywords to each place.

|*Pros*
|*Ease-of-implementation*: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
*Refined results*: This approach provides more refined results as it narrows down the search scope to only what the user needs.

|*Faster search*: Faster searching as HashMap lookup runs in O(1) time.

|*Cons*
|*Slower search*: This approach is less efficient as the entire list needs to be searched through.
|*Memory-consuming*. This approach requires more memory as a separate HashMap needs to be stored.
|=======================================================================
*Decision*: Alternative 1 of using a list is preferred as it uses less memory compared to alternative 2. Moreover, future contributors to the project are likely to be student undergraduates, so a simple data structure would be more optimal for educational purposes.
// end::search[]

// tag::countrycode[]
=== Add Feature
The `add` command is used to add a place into TravelBuddy. The user can add the following details related to the
place:

* Name
* Country Code
* Date Visited
* Rating
* Address
* Description
* Tag (Optional)

[NOTE]
The Country Code adheres to the three-letters ISO-3166 standard. The full list of Country Codes can be found in
CountryCodes.adoc

==== Current Implementation

Given below is a sequence of steps, illustrating the interaction between various classes when the add command is
entered.

image::AddCommandSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
Figure 10: Add Command Sequence Diagram

Step 1: The user enters the command `add n/NUS Computing cc/SGP dv/10/10/2017 r/3 d/My School a/13 Computing Drive,
117417 t/faculty`.

Step 2: The command is processed by the Logic component, which will then call `LogicManager#execute()`.

Step 3: `TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()` is invoked, which is also located in the Logic component.

Step 4: `AddCommandParser#AddCommandParser()` is invoked.

Step 5: The `AddCommandParser#parse()` is called and receives the command with the arguments given as a string.

Step 6: The `AddCommandParser` interprets the arguments and constructs an `AddCommand`.

Step 7: The `AddCommand` with a Place specified by the user is returned.

Step 8: The `AddCommand#execute()` method is invoked.

Step 9: The `Model#addPlace()` method is invoked with the argument `toAdd`. The `Model#commitTravelBuddy()` method is
 also invoked.

Step 10: The `TravelBuddy#addPlace()` method is invoked by `Model` with the argument `toAdd`.

Step 11: A result object is returned.

===== Add Command
Given below is an example usage scenario and what the user will see in the GUI.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with no places.

image::AddCommandStep1.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user enters the full add command `add n/NUS Computing cc/SGP dv/10/10/2017 r/3 d/My School a/13 Computing Drive,
117417 t/faculty` to add the place to TravelBuddy and presses enter. TravelBuddy will start executing the steps mentioned in Figure 10.

image::AddCommandStep2.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The command `add` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by TravelBuddy.


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure to store Country Codes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use enum specified in java.util.Locales.
** Pros: Easy to implement and contains all three-letters country codes specified in ISO-3166.
** Cons: Slightly slow in searching for country code.
* **Alternative 2:** Create own data structure containing most commonly traveled countries in the world.
** Pros: Locating country code in data structure would be faster than Alternative 1.
** Cons: Tedious process of typing out country codes in the data structure.
// end::countrycode[]

// tag::chartFeature[]
=== Chart Feature

The Chart feature displays to users three different charts in TravelBuddy. They are:

* The Number of Places Visited by Rating Category
* The Number of Places Visited by Year
* The Number of Places Visited by Country

The Chart feature is activated in TravelBuddy by default when the application launches. Alternatively, the `generate` command is also used to generate the charts. The `generate` command does not require any parameters.

[TIP]
Instead of typing `generate`, you can simply type the shortcut `g`.

==== Current Implementation

*Logic:* The `generate` mechanism is executed by `GenerateCommand`, which extends from `Command`. A code snippet is shown below:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourceDir}/seedu/travel/logic/commands/GenerateCommand.java[tags=execute,indent=1]
----

In the snippet, the operations implemented are:

* `GenerateCommand#setChartDisplayed(chartDisplayed)` - Signals to the UI to display the charts.
* `GenerateCommand#commitTravelBuddy()` - Saves the current TravelBuddy state from its history.
* `GenerateCommand#getFilteredPlaceList()` - Verifies if the list is empty.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setChartDisplayed(chartDisplayed)`, `Model#commitTravelBuddy()` and `Model#getFilteredPlaceList()`.

*Model:* The chart generation mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTravelBuddy`, which extends from `TravelBuddy`, as seen in the Model Class Diagram in <<ModelClassDiagram>>.

[[chartOopDiagramFigure]]
.OOP Diagram
image::Chart_ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="590", caption="Figure 4.4.1: ", reftext="Figure 4.4.1"]

For this section on Charts, the focus is on the <<class-diagram, class diagram>> as seen in <<chartOopDiagramFigure>>. The step-by-step explanation of the class diagram can be found below:

. The `ModelManager` is a container for a `VersionedTravelBuddy` object.
. VersionedTravelBuddy consists of a `UniquePlaceList` object.
. `UniquePlaceList` is a container for one or more `ChartBook` objects and for one or more `Place` object.
. `ChartBook` consists of a `CountryChartList` object, a `RatingChartList` object and a `YearChartList` object.
. `countryChartList` is a container for one or more `CountryChart` objects. Similarly, `ratingChartList` is a container for one or more `RatingChart` objects and `yearChartList` is a container for one or more `YearChart` objects.
. `CountryChart` consists of a `CountryCode` object and a `Total` object. Similarly, `RatingChart` consists of a `Rating` object and a `Total` object and `YearChart` consists of a `Year` object and a `Total` object.

*Logic & Model Interaction:* Having discussed Logic and Model, we can now model the workflow of the `generate` command. This can be accomplished using an <<activity-diagram, activity diagram>>, as seen in <<GenerateCommandActivityDiagram>>.

Additionally, we want to be able to capture the interaction between multiple objects for the `generate` command. This can be accomplished using a <<sequence-diagram, sequence diagram>>, as seen in <<GenerateCommandSeqDiagramFigure>> below. The step-by-step explanation of the sequence diagram is as follows:

. The user enters the command `generate` without any parameters.
. The command is processed by the Logic component, which will then call `LogicManager#execute()`.
. The `GenerateCommand#execute()` method is invoked.
. The `Model#setChartDisplayed()` method is invoked with the argument `true`. The `Model#commitTravelBuddy()` method is also invoked.
. The `TravelBuddy#commitTravelBuddy()` method is invoked by `Model`.
. The `ChartBook#commitChart()` method is invoked by `TravelBuddy`.
. A result object is returned.

[[GenerateCommandSeqDiagramFigure]]
.Sequence Diagram for the `generate` command
image::GenerateCommandSeqDiagram.png[width="700", caption="Figure 4.4.3: ", reftext="Figure 4.4.3"]

*Storage:* The Chart's storage is handled by `JsonChartBookStorage`, which implements from `ChartBookStorage`. The three main methods it implements are:

* `saveCountryChart(filePath)` - Saves the countries data into a JSON file.
* `saveRatingChart(filePath)` - Saves the ratings data into a JSON file.
* `saveYearChart(filePath)` - Saves the years data into a JSON file.

A code snippet for `saveCountryChart(filePath)` is shown below.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourceDir}/seedu/travel/storage/JsonChartBookStorage.java[tags=saveCountryChart,indent=1]
----

In the snippet, a third-party library called Gson was used to convert Java Objects into JSON and back. The Gson API can be found https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.5[here]. A step-by-step explanation is as follows:

. The method accepts two parameters, namely a `ReadOnlyCountryChart` object, which supplies the data for the Country Chart, and a `Path` object, which specifies the file path for the `FileWriter` to write into.
. Both parameters are checked by `requireAllNonNull` to make sure they are not empty.
. A `Gson` object is instantiated using the `GsonBuilder` 's `create` method.
. A `FileWriter` object is instantiated with the `Path` object as its parameter. If an `IOException` occurs, a warning message will be displayed by the `Logger` object.
. Assuming there are no exceptions, `Gson#toJson()` will serialize the `ReadOnlyCountryChart` data as a `JsonObject` and places the stream on `FileWriter`.
. The `FileWriter#flush()` flushes the stream.

==== Generate Command

*Preconditions:* Given below is a list of preconditions that must be met for the `generate` command to work:

* By default, the charts are automatically generated each time TravelBuddy loads.
* The `generate` command always triggers the display of all three charts.
* The charts always update themselves in real-time. +
_Example:_ When a place is added via the `add` command, the charts are automatically updated so that no `generate` command is necessary.
* The chart will not display anything when the list is empty.
* You can type in any parameters after the `generate` command, TravelBuddy will simply ignore them.

*Example:* Given below is an example usage scenario and what the user will see in the GUI.

*Step 1:* By default, the charts are displayed when TravelBuddy launches. To navigate away from the charts, type in `select 1`. +
*Outcome:* The first index in the place list will be selected and displayed on the right-hand side of the panel..

*Step 2:* Type in `generate` to generate the charts.. +
*Outcome:* The charts will be displayed on the right-hand side of the panel..

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How Chart Generation Executes

[width="100%",cols="16%,<50%,<50%",options="header"]
|=======================================================================

|
|*Alternative 1 (current choice)*
|*Alternative 2*

|*Description*
|Updates the charts both in real-time and when the `generate` command is used.
|Updates the charts only when the `generate` command is used.

|*Pros*
|*Ease-of-use*. This approach is more user-friendly, as users do not need to type an additional `generate` command after changes are made to the Place list. +
*Accuracy*. This approach is more accurate as the charts reflect the latest changes regardless of whether the user types the `generate` command.

|*Scalability*. This approach is computationally less intensive, as the charts are only generated when required.

|*Cons*
|*Scalability*. This approach is computationally more intensive, especially when the Place list is huge, as all three charts need to be regenerated every time a change is detected.
|*Ease-of-use*. This approach is Less user-friendly as users will need to type the `generate` command for the charts to reflect the changes made to the Place list. +
*Accuracy*. This approach is less accurate as the charts does not reflect the latest changes until the user types the `generate` command.

|*Example*
|As shown in <<Generate_BeforeEditAfterEdit>>, before the `edit 1 cc/USA` command was executed, the chart did not have a separate bar for USA. After the command was executed, the chart updated in real-time to include a bar for USA. All this was done without invoking the `generate` command.
|N.A.
|=======================================================================

*Decision:* Alternative 1, which is to update the charts in real-time, was adopted as it promotes ease-of-use, so users are not required to type in an additional `generate` command whenever changes are made to the Place list. Moreover, Alternative 1 is the more accurate option of the two, as the chart reflects the latest changes even if the user forgets to type the `generate` command.

//end::chartFeature[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and
logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See
<<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead
of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the
configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more
flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to
preview the end result of your edits. Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows
you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF Format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as
Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc
files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google
 Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best
results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor
.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project
are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and
experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to
platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of Tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.travel.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.travel.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be
 working). +
e.g. `seedu.travel.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are
connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.travel.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/travel/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, TravelBuddy depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
