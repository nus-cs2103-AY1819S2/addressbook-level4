== What is it about?
Have you ever faced the problem of not having a place to store all the information you search online or the notes you take?
Well,  we have! Therefore, through our application, The Infinity Machine, we have created a platform where the storing and
retrieving of textual information such as research materials can be done efficiently. It also allows you to apply custom
made tags and descriptions for easy categorization, search and retrieval.
Other useful functionalities implemented are:
- Bibliography generator
- Panic/unpanic mode
- Restore command
- History command and many more!

== Target Users
Tech-savvy university students or researchers who love to use the Command line Interface and wish to organize and tag
research information or any other data that they may wish to store for a long time, frequently performing basic operations
such as adding, editing, deleting and searching an entry.
