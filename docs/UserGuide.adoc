== Introduction

Ships ahoy! Battleship is a simple computer-based remake of the classic Battleship game. It is for people who want to have the joy of playing Battleships without the hassle and fuss of dealing with physical game pieces.

Battleship is optimised for people who want to use a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

It can guarantee many hours of fun, especially between those long and boring periods of the day. Can't wait to get started? Head over to <<Quick Start>> to fire away!

[NOTE]
====
*What is a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI)?* +
An interface is how a user interacts with the computer. For example, you can use a mouse to click on a file to open it in Windows or MacOS. This is part of the interface for these operating systems. +

A Command Line Interface (CLI) interacts with the user by accepting words that are typed in by the user. Conversely, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) interacts with the user visually. It uses icons and graphics to show the user what the program is doing.
====

As you will see, Battleship is a hybrid application. It combines both a CLI and GUI, meaning that the user must type in commands but will see the changes caused by those commands graphically.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `battleship.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-3/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Battleship.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type commands in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute them. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  To begin playing, first initialise the map to a size between 6 to 10. eg: `init 6`.
.  Deploy your battleships:
..  Deploy your aircraft carrier: `put n/aircraft carrier c/a1 r/h`
..  Deploy your cruiser: `put n/cruiser c/c1 r/h`
..  Deploy your destroyer: `put n/destroyer c/e1 r/h`
.  Start the game: `start game`
.  Shoot the enemy's map at a specific cell. eg: `shoot a1`

The game will go on until either party's ships are totally destroyed.

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Game Rules
// tag::gamerules[]
This section will describe the game rules and how to play the classic Battleship game.
====
*Goal*

Sink all your opponent's battleships before they sink yours.
====
====
*Captain, deploy ships!*

Depending on the chosen size of the map, as specified through the `init <map_size>` command,
the player will be given different numbers of each ship.

The ships available are:

* Cruiser: size 2
* Destroyer: size 3
* Aircraft Carrier: size 5

Here are the respective number of each ship in your fleet, depending
on your map size.

====
====
*Ready, aim, fire!*

The Player will always be given the first turn.
The Player may fire shots at the enemy map through the command `shoot`, for example `shoot a1`.

If the shot hits a ship, the Player may continue taking shots until they miss.
Upon a miss, the turn will be handed over to the enemy.
The same goes for the enemy - the enemy will take its shot automatically, firing until it misses, before
passing the turn back to the Player.
====

====
*Good Game!*

Whoever is first to destroy all their opponent's ship will be declared the winner.
Had fun? You can view the game statistics with the command `stats`.
====
// end::gamerules[]


[[Features]]
== Features
This section will describe the features of the game in more detail.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `init MAP_SIZE`, `MAP_SIZE` is a parameter which can be used as `init 10`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `put n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `put n/Destroyer t/bestship` or as `put n/Destroyer`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/alpha`, `t/best t/captain` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME c/COORDINATES`, `c/COORDINATES n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

[NOTE]
====
Some commands can only be executed at some part of the game, e.g. `attack` can only be executed
when the battle is ongoing. If you try to enter a command that is not allowed at that point in
time, the program will tell you so.
====

=== General commands

This section describes commands that can be executed at any point of time during the game.

==== Viewing help : `help`
Opens a help window that displays this User Guide. +
Format: `help`

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

// tag::map[]

=== Preparation phase
This section describes the commands used in the preparation phase.

==== Initialising the maps : `init`

The `init` command initialises both your map and the enemy AI's map to the size that you specify. The size of the maps must be between 6 and 10, inclusive. +

Format: `init MAP_SIZE` +
Example: `init 10`

****
* The `init` command can be used at any point in time during gameplay. When used in the middle of a game, the `init` command functions like a "new game" command and will reset the board to a clean state.
* Each cell is represented by its coordinates e.g "b1". The coordinates will be used by the other commands to refere to a cell.
****

_Figure 1_ below shows how the maps will be displayed in the UI.

.The game maps
image::initmapresult.png[width=750]

{empty} +
Throughout the course of the game, the cells in the map will change colour based on their status. +

[NOTE]
====
.Cell statuses:
- Hidden - Enemy map cell that has not been hit
- Water - Empty (i.e cell with no ship) player cell that has not been hit
- Water Hit - Empty cell that has been hit
- Ship - Player cell that has a ship and has not been hit
- Ship Hit - Ship cell that has been hit but not yet destroyed
- Ship Destroyed - Ship cell that has been destroyed
====

// end::map[]

// tag::ship[]

==== Managing ships:
===== Placing a ship on the map: `put`

Adds a battleship onto the player's map. The coordinates specified is the position of the ship's head. +

Format: `put n/NAME c/COORDINATES r/ORIENTATION [t/TAGS]` +

Examples:

* `put n/Destroyer c/a1 r/vertical`
* `put n/Aircraft Carrier c/b1 r/h t/tag1` +

The head of a battleship is the top-most and left-most cell of the battleship. When coordinates are specified in the `put` command, it specifies the coordinates of the head of the battleship, as shown in the figure below.

.The coordinates of the `put` command refer to the coordinates of the battleship head.
image::BattleshipHeadExample2.png[width=400, align="center"]

The orientation of the ship can be `horizontal` or `vertical`. This may be shortened to `h` or `v`, respectively. The orientation of the battleship must be specified. +

When putting a ship on the map grid, you should specify the head coordinates such that:

* The ship falls within the map grid.
* The ship does not collide with another ship that is already on the map grid.

// end::ship[]

// tag::list[]
===== Listing all ships : `list`

Shows a list of all the player's battleships that are have been deployed on the map. There are four ways of using the `list` command:

1. List all ships: `list`.
2. List ships that match certain tags: `list t/[TAGS]`.
3. List certain ships: `list n/[NAME]`.
4. List certain ships that match certain tags: `list n/[NAME] t/[TAGS]`

Examples:

* `list`
* `list t/blueFleet`
* `list n/destroyer`
* `list n/destroyer n/cruiser t/blueFleet t/greenFleet`

The list will show the battleship's head coordinate, the battleship's orientation, and the battleship's tags in square brackets. The format of each entry in the list is: `[NAME] [CURRENT LIFE] at [HEAD COORDINATE] [ORIENTATION] [TAGS]`. An example is given below.

[source,text]
----
Input:      list n/destroyer t/blueFleet t/greenFleet
Output:     destroyer (3/3) at g5 vertical [redFleet][blueFleet][greenFleet]
            destroyer (3/3) at c3 horizontal [blueFleet][greenFleet]
----
// end::list[]

// tag::listTags[]
===== Listing all tags: `listTags`

Lists all the tags that have been used to tag the battleships deployed on the map. +

Format: `listTags` +
Examples: `listTags`

The list of tags is given in square brackets.

// end::listTags[]

// tag::battle[]
=== Battle phase

==== Beginning the battle: `begin`

Begins the battle against the computer enemy. +
Format: `begin` +
Alternative command: `start`

****
* After this command is entered, the program's AI will place its own ships.
* After the AI completes its placing of ships, you can take your first turn.
****

==== Shooting at a coordinate: `shoot`

Launches an attack against given coordinate on the enemy's map. +
Format: `shoot COORDINATES` +
Alternative commands: `attack`, `fire`, `hit`

Examples:

* `shoot a6`
* `attack b5`

****
* The program will prevent you from attacking an invalid coordinate.
* The program will prevent you from attacking a square that you have already attacked.
* If you hit one of the opponent's ships, you may make another attack.
  Otherwise, the enemy will take their turn(s), firing until they get a miss.
****

// end::battle[]

// tag::stats[]
==== Retrieving game statistics: `stats`

Retrieves the gameplay statistics data displays them on a pop-up window.

Format: `stats`

Example:

* `stats`

****
* The pop-up window will contain a bar chart visualisation of your game play data
* The pop-up window does not update itself when it is opened and the `stats` command must be called again to display updated
values.
****

== Coming in v2.0
This section describes features that have not been implemented yet and are scheduled to be released in version 2.0.

=== Special map shapes
You will be allowed to use maps that are randomised in shape. This adds an extra layer of challenge and fun.

Both yourself and the computer AI will not be able to place ships on the grey tiles. The enemy AI will also have a randomised map that will not be the same as your map. You will not be able to see the shape of the enemy map and can shoot grey cells which will be counted as a miss.

The image below shows an example of a randomised map.

.Example of a random map shape
