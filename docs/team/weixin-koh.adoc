== PROJECT: FoodDiary      image:ppp-kwx.png[width="200"]

== Overview

This project portfolio page documents my contributions to *_The Food Diary_*, a software engineering project undertaken as part of the Software Engineering module, CS2103T, during my undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore (NUS).
This application is written in Java and has about 10,000 lines of code. It utilizes Command Line Interface (CLI) and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using JavaFX.

*_The Food Diary_* is a desktop application morphed from a basic CLI AddressBook.
Through our *Software Engineering* module, CS2103T, my team and I chose to morph the AddressBook into a The Food Diary for food lovers of all ages to document their very own food adventure.
In this project, I was tasked with enhancing the user's experience by generating average ratings from their reviews for each restaurant.

The main features of *_The Food Diary_* include:

* Adding, editing and deleting restaurants
* Adding, editing and deleting reviews
* Getting average ratings for restaurants based on personal reviews
* Get recommendations to new restaurants nearby

== Summary of Contributions

The following shows a summary of the contributions I made to this team project.

* *Major Enhancement*: I added the ability to *generate and display average restaurant data*.
** *What it does*: Generates average rating from all the reviews of a restaurant and displays it as part of the restaurant's information card as well as in its summary.
** *Justification*: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now immediately see his/her personal ratings across all the visits they have made for a restaurant.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement required in-depth analysis of other alternatives before structuring its model. Additionally, it relied heavily on XML-based user interface markup language, FXML. Thus, I had to learn pick up this language from scratch to display this new `UiPart`.
The implementation was also challenging as it involved multiple components, namely `Model`, `Logic` and `Ui`, for it to work.

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. Since our project is a Food Diary targeted at food lovers, we have
come up with instructions on how to use the application for users of all ages. The following is an excerpt about the `select`
feature I enhanced, as well as the proposed features for sorting restaurants by rating and sharing reviews to Facebook._
