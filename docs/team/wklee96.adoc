== PROJECT: The Food Diary

---

== Overview

This project portfolio page serves to document my contributions to The Food Diary, a software engineering project that
was undertaken as part of the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computingâ€™s Software Engineering module.
In a team of five students, we worked on a well established application, Address Book 4, of ten thousand lines of code, and
morphed it into the application we have now.

The Food Diary is designed for food lovers whose wish to document their experiences at a restaurants in a fast and simple fashion.
It serves as a journal, allowing the users to give reviews and ratings to the restaurant that they have been to.

My role in this project is to implement a function that allows food lovers to visit the website of restaurants so that they
can reference the website while writing a review.

The following symbol can help you better understand the some considerations that I had as you read through
my contributions to the User Guide and Developer Guide

[NOTE]
This is a *note*. A note indicates important additional information that should be read.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to visit website of restaurants*
** What it does: This feature allows users to view website of visited and unvisited restaurants.
** Justification:
*** Since users may not remember every details of the restaurant, the feature to display website of restaurants allow users to reference restaurant's website while writing a review for the restaurant.
** Highlights: This feature requires understanding of java.net library and also handling tricky errors that can arise when connecting to the internet to load websites.
** Credits: Used java.net package to validate websites before allowing users to add them into restaurant class.

* *Minor enhancement*: Enhance add and edit function to validate weblink before adding restaurant into Food Diary.
If there is no internet, Food Diary will proceed to add or edit the restaurant without the weblink. This way, no restaurants with invalid weblink will be added.

* *Code contributed*: Here's a https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=wklee96&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-04&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[link] to my code on the Project Code Dashboard.
** Project management:
*** Set-up GitHub organisation to fork Address Book 4
*** Create a dummy GitHub account perform Continuous Integration for our project.
*** Managed release of v1.2
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Changed fields of add command to be optional so that users can add restaurants with minimal information. https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/152[#152]
*** Added Opening Hour class and Weblink class as new parameters for Restaurant https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/29[#29], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/17[#17]
*** Updated sample data https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/17[#17]
** Documentation:
*** Updated README https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/7[#7]
*** Updated User Guide and Developer Guide on visitWeb feature https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/106[#106] https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/150[#150]
** Community:
*** Actively looked through and approved PRs, providing constructive comments to codes https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/103[#103], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/95[#95], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/pull/148[#148]
*** Actively test and find bugs that the application can possibly have. Made used of GitHub issue tracker to organise these findings. https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/issues/145[#145], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-1/main/issues/65[#65]
** Tools:
*** Enabled auto-publishing of documentation for our project.


== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_The user guide acts as a instruction manual for new users. For my part, I enhanced the add and edit feature and implemented the visitWeb command feature. Below is an excerpt of Food Diary's User Guide that I added which shows my contributions to Food Diary and the documentations that I have written._

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_The following shows my addition to the developer guide for visitWeb feature. It also illustrates the considerations and the thought process that I had when I was designing and implementing this feature_
