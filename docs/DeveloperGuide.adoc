== Introduction

Welcome to the _MediTabs Developer Guide_. This guide contains step by step instructions on how to set up the MediTabs project on your computer and modify the project to suit your needs. You can also find out more about the technical aspects of MediTabs such as its design rationales and implementation details. Interested? You can jump to <<Setting up>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== What is MediTabs

MediTabs is a desktop application, developed using Java, for managing medicine stock taking. It was created to provide pharmacist with a straightforward and efficient way to keep track of and maintain their medicine inventory. With MediTabs, pharmacist can easily organize medicine details and take note of important information such as which medicines are low in stock, expiring soon or have expired. MediTabs also contains functionality to help pharmacists with tasks which require medicine data such as medicine labelling and inventory analysis.

MediTabs supports Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems.

=== Who is this guide for?

Are you a developer who wants to learn how MediTabs is designed and implemented, contribute to the development of MediTabs or modify MediTabs for your needs? If so, this guide provides information that will not only help you better understand the inner workings of MediTabs but also the various classes provided which you can use when modifying MediTabs.

// tag::settingup[]
== Setting up

Follow the step by step instructions below to set up MediTabs project with IntelliJ Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

[NOTE]
You are free to use any IDE which you are comfortable with but we *highly recommend* using IntelliJ. As we use IntelliJ in the development of MediTabs, the instructions to set up MediTabs will be catered for users of IntelliJ. You can download IntelliJ link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[here]. If you are planning to use IntelliJ, both the community (free) and ultimate (paid) editions of IntelliJ can be used to set up MediTabs project.
// end::settingup[]

// tag::prerequisites[]
=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9` (highly recommended) or `10`*
+
[NOTE]
JDK `11` and later are not recommended due to some features being removed which were once available in JDK `9`. You can read more about the issue highlighted from the developers of the base source code which MediTabs is based on and improved upon link:https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/951[here]
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.
// end::prerequisites[]

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project on your computer

. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all the resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-3 branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteMedicine.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::uicomponent[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::uicomponent[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MedicineListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `InformationPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `InventoryParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a Medicine).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="900"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Inventory data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Medicine>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// tag::modelcomponentobjectdiagram[]
Given below is an object diagram to better illustrate how details of a medicine is stored in the `Model` component.

.An example of how the medicine "Paracetamol" could be represented by the `Medicine` class.
image::ModelMedicineObjectDiagram.png[width="900"]

// end::modelcomponentobjectdiagram[]

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Inventory`, which `Medicine` can reference. This would allow `Inventory` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Medicine` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
// tag::storagecomponent[]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::storagecomponent[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the medicine inventory data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section provides you with some description of how certain key features of our product are being implemented.

// tag::informationpanel[]
=== Information Panel
==== Current Implementation

The information panel is mainly driven by `InformationPanel` which extends `UiPart` with an added mechanism to interact with the currently selected medicine and information panel settings.
It implements the following main operations:

* `InformationPanel#showSelectedInformation(Medicine medicine)` -- Creates and displays a `BatchTable` that contains information of the selected medicine and its batches. Values in the `BatchTable` are sorted according to `SortProperty` and `SortDirection` specified in `InformationPanelSettings` stored in `InformationPanel`.
* `InformationPanel#emptyInformationPanel()` -- Deletes the `BatchTable` being displayed to show an empty pane.

These operations are hidden and are only triggered when the value of the selected medicine or information panel settings changes. The `InformationPanel` is initialized with the selected medicine and information panel settings passed in as `ObservableValue<Medicine>` and `ObservableValue<InformationPanelSettings` objects and `ChangeListener` objects are added to them. `ChangeListener#changed(ObservableValue<? extends T> observable, T oldValue, T newValue)` is called whenever the values in either of the `ObservableValue` objects changes.

Given below is a diagram showing the execution of `InformationPanel` when a change to the selected medicine occurs. `informationPanel` variable seen in the diagram is a `StackPane` object used to display the created `BatchTable` by adding it as a child node.

.Sequence Diagram for InformationPanel when a change in selected medicine occurs
image::InformationPanelSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the information panel behaves at each step when the selected medicine changes.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The selected medicine is always null when the application is launched. An empty `InformationPanel` is displayed.

Step 2. The user executes `select 1` command to select the 1st medicine in the inventory. Since the new value is not null, `InformationPanel#showSelectedInformation(Medicine medicine)` is called. A new `BatchTable` with information of the selected medicine is created and displayed.

[NOTE]
An `update` command will also cause `ChangeListener#changed(ObservableValue<? extends T> observable, T oldValue, T newValue)` to be called as although the same medicine is still selected, the medicine is replaced in the `Inventory` with updated fields.

Step 3. The user executes `find n/Paracetamol`. The `find` command deselects the selected medicine and the new value is null. Only `InformationPanel#emptyInformationPanel()` is executed.

Changes to the information panel settings results in a similar sequence of events, except the new value of `InformationPanelSettings` is saved in `InformationPanel` before `InformationPanel#display()` is called.

Given below is another example usage scenario of how the information panel interacts with `InformationPanelSettings` and the `sort` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `InformationPanelSettings` stored in `Model` is passed as an `ObservableValue<InformationPanelSettings>` to initialize the `InformationPanel`.

Step 2. The user executes `sort p/quantity d/ascending` command to sort all batch tables by quantity in ascending order. The `sort` command calls `Model#setInformationPanelSettings(InformationPanelSettings informationPanelSettings))` which changes the value of the `InformationPanelSettings` in `Model`. The new `InformationPanelSettings` is saved in `InformationPanel`. If the selected medicine is not null, `InformationPanel#showSelectedInformation(Medicine medicine)` is called. Given below is an activity diagram to show how the saved `InformationPanelSettings` is used to sort the `BatchTable` during its initialization. A `TableView` object populated with the details of the selected medicine is created before the sorting takes place.

.Activity Diagram demonstrating how BatchTable is sorted during initialization
image::InformationPanelActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]

[NOTE]
For more information on the `TableView` class, you may refer to its API https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/TableView.html[here].

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the information panel executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new `BatchTable` to be displayed every time a new medicine is selected.
** Pros: Information can be taken from `Model` component during initialization so no extra memory is needed to store table information.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time needed to retrieve the information and build the table, especially if number of batches becomes huge.
* **Alternative 2:** Save created `BatchTables` as a field in `Medicine`.
** Pros: Save time needed for creating the `BatchTable` for faster response time.
** Cons: More memory needed to store `BatchTable`. `BatchTable` may still have to be recreated if the details of the `Medicine` are changed after the `BatchTable` has been created.

=== Exporting as CSV file format

This section provides you with an overview of how exporting as Comma-separated values (CSV) file format is implemented in MediTabs and the design considerations made by our team with regards to its implementation.

==== Current Implementation

The exporting as CSV file format mechanism is facilitated by `CsvWrapper`.
It is built on top of the `Opencsv` Java CSV parser library, licensed under the `Apache 2 OSS License`, so that it integrates with our product. This is done by providing additional operations to support exporting the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI to CSV file format.

There are many additional operations added in `CsvWrapper` but we will only list the key operations which are the main drivers of the overall implementation of the feature for easier reference and understanding.

The key operations are as follows:

* `CsvWrapper#export()` -- Export the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI to CSV file format.
* `CsvWrapper#createCsvFile(String csvFileName)` -- Creates a CSV file with the file name based on the `csvFileName` input. The file is created in the default `exported` directory which is located in the same directory as our product application.
[NOTE]
If the default `exported` directory is not found, it will be automatically created.
* `CsvWrapper#writeDataToCsv(List currentGuiList)` -- Writes the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI to the CSV file created by the `CsvWrapper#createCsvFile(String csvFileName)` operation.

[NOTE]
Out of the three key operations stated above, *only* `CsvWrapper#export()` is a _public_ operation available for use by other components. It acts as the main interface which other components use to interact with `CsvWrapper` in order to integrate exporting to CSV file format feature into their own implementation.

Given below is a sequence diagram overview of how these 3 key operations behave when the user executes the `export` command in order to export the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI to CSV file format:

.Export Command Sequence Diagram Overview
image::ExportCommandSequenceDiagramOverview.png[width="800"]

Given below is a brief description of how the exporting as CSV file format mechanism behaves as shown in the sequence diagram above:

Step 1: When the user executes the `export` command, assuming parsing of the command line arguments have already been completed, the `ExportCommand#execute()` operation is called.

Step 2: The `ExportCommand#execute()` operation initialises the `CsvWrapper` with the _file name of the CSV file to be stored_ and _the current model instance_ as its input parameters.

Step 3: The `ExportCommand#execute()` operation then calls `CsvWrapper#export()` operation which is the first key operation implementing the export to CSV file format feature.

Step 4: The `CsvWrapper#export()` operation retrieves the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI by calling the `Model#getFilteredMedicineList()` operation.

Step 5: After retrieving the data, the `CsvWrapper#createCsvFile(String csvFileName)` operation, which is the second key operation, is called. It creates an empty CSV file with the input file name in the default `exported` directory.

[NOTE]
If a CSV file with the input file name already exists in the `exported` directory, a `"Could not export data to csv file: {Input File Name} already exists in "exported" directory"` exception will be shown in the `ResultDisplay` panel of the GUI as a `CommandException` is thrown and the exporting process will stop executing. In other words, the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI would not be exported.

Step 6: After the empty CSV file is created, the `CsvWrapper#writeDataToCsv(List currentGuiList)`, which is the third key operation, is called to process the current medicine inventory data retrieved earlier in Step 4 and writes to the CSV file in an organised format for easier reference by the users of the exported CSV file.

Step 7: The current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI is exported successfully to CSV file format.

Step 8: The `ExportCommand#execute()` operation returns a `CommandResult` which shows the current list is exported to a CSV file with the input file name.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `export` command:

.Export Command Activity Diagram
image::ExportCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How exporting as CSV file format executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Exports the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI to CSV file format using the `export` command.
** Pros: Easy to implement and users can preview the data before exporting.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual commands can add an additional `export` parameter to support exporting as CSV file format.
** Pros: Users can export directly through individual commands which support the additional `export` parameter (e.g. The `find` command with its additional `export` parameter set to true, exports the filtered medicine inventory data immediately without having to retrieve from `Model#getFilteredMedicineList()` operation).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation and integration of the exporting to CSV file of each individual commands are correct. Furthermore, users are not able to preview the data before exporting.

===== Aspect: Data structure/Algorithm/Implementation to support the `export` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate through each of the medicine in the list retrieved from `Model#getFilterMedicineList()` operation to build the structure in which the data is organised when exported to CSV file format.
** Pros: Easy for developers to understand, especially for those who want to modify the way in which the data is organised when exported to CSV file format but have no prior knowledge on `Opencsv` Java CSV parser library.
** Cons: The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) and might not be as efficient especially when a large amount of data is involved. Furthermore, it does not take full advantage of the more advanced features provided by the `Opencsv` Java CSV parser library.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Opencsv` Java CSV parser library's `StatefulBeanToCsvBuilder` operation for building the structure in which the data is organised from the list retrieved using the `Model#getFilterMedicineList()` operation when exporting to CSV file format.
** Pros: Does not require iterating through the list and convert it to a String Array as we can use the library's `StatefulBeanToCsvBuilder` operation to build the structure from the list by passing the list as a parameter to the operation. Furthermore, the formatting process can be automated using the operation. It is also more efficient in terms of performance according to the library's documentation if the ordering of the data exported is not a concern to the developer.
** Cons: Requires prior knowledge on the way in which the library's `StatefulBeanToCsvBuilder` operation works. If a developer wants to modify the data exported to be ordered in a specific format, it requires knowledge on the library's `MappingStrategy` related operations which may be complicated for developers new to the library.
[NOTE]
More information on `Opencsv` library's `StatefulBeanToCsvBuilder` operation can be found in the library's link:http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/[documentation].
// end::exportcommand[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInventory`.
It extends `Inventory` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `inventoryStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedInventory#commit()` -- Saves the current inventory state in its history.
* `VersionedInventory#undo()` -- Restores the previous inventory state from its history.
* `VersionedInventory#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone inventory state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitInventory()`, `Model#undoInventory()` and `Model#redoInventory()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInventory` will be initialized with the initial inventory state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single inventory state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th medicine in the inventory. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitInventory()`, causing the modified state of the inventory after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `inventoryStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted inventory state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Paracetamol ...` to add a new medicine. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitInventory()`, causing another modified inventory state to be saved into the `inventoryStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitInventory()`, so the inventory state will not be saved into the `inventoryStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the medicine was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoInventory()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous inventory state, and restores the inventory to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial inventory state, then there are no previous inventory states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoInventory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoInventory()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the inventory to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `inventoryStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest inventory state, then there are no undone inventory states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoInventory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the inventory, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitInventory()`, `Model#undoInventory()` or `Model#redoInventory()`. Thus, the `inventoryStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitInventory()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `inventoryStateList`, all inventory states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/Paracetamol ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire inventory.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the medicine being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of inventory states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedInventory`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::labelcommand[]
=== Medicine Label using Label Command

Users can use the command to output medicines information to the PDF folder. Information will be in Portable Document Format (PDF).

Current implementation:
The label command uses Apache PDFBox, a 3rd party library capable of creating and editing PDF files. To import the library:
Locate the build.gradle file under the main folder. Insert the new dependency implementation group: `org.apache.pdfbox`, name: `pdfbox`, version: `2.0.13`.
This imports the library over to the project for use. You can look at <<Managing Dependencies>> for more information on 3rd party libraries.

There are many classes available in the Apache PDFBox, the key operations that we are using are:

* `PDDocument` - For creating a new blank PDF file for the medicine details to be exported to.
* `PDPage` - Creates a new PDPage instance for embedding.
* `PDPageContentStream` - Provides the ability to write a page content stream.

The following sequence diagram shows how the label operation works:

image::LabelUML.png[width="800"]
Fig 4.4 UML sequence diagram

==== Usage scenario example
===== Label command without filename behaviour:

.  The user launches the application for the first time. An empty InformationPanel is displayed. (Fig 4.4.1.1)

.  The user executes the `label 2` to output the label of the 2nd medicine indexed in the inventory. Since no file name is included in the argument, the default filename 'to_print' is used instead.
- Based on the UML diagram above, "label 2" will be passed onto the `InventoryParser`. LabelCommand will be created and returned to the logic manager.
- Logic manager will `execute()` the `LabelCommand`. The PDF file will be created using the `PDFWrapper` class.

.  The user can find the file `to_print` under the main folder. (Fig 4.5.3)

image::label2_taken.png[width="790"]

image::folderPDF.png[width="790"]
Fig 4.4.1.2 (PDF folder highlighted)

===== Label command with filename behaviour:

.  The user executes `label 1 f/file_to_print` to output the label of the 1st medicine indexed in the inventory. The `InventoryParser` class will be able to tokenize and read the desired file name. LabelCommand will be created and return to the logic manager.
- Logic manager will `execute()` the `LabelCommand`. The PDF file will be created using the `PDFWrapper` class.

.   The user can find a new file `file_to_print` under the same main folder.

The following activity diagram shows the behaviours in summary (Fig 4.4.1.3):

image::LabelActivityDiagram.png[width="790"]
(Fig 4.4.1.3)

[NOTE]
If the user would execute another `label 1`, the original `to_print` file will be replaced. Users are warned in the User Guide to be caution about overwriting files.



==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: How label executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new `PDFDocument` every time a medicine it to be labeled.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Uses more of the user computer memory space as it creates the temporary file.
* **Alternative 2:** Find the existing PDF file and edit.
** Pros: Will use less memory.
** Cons: We have to read the existing file which requires more time to execute. PDF files are also meant to not be edited once created.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

Data encryption is likely to be implemented in future versions of the MediTabs if a reasonable implementation is found.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How data encryption is executed

* **Alternative 1:** Encrypt the entire inventory.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Use existing encryption libraries to encrypt the entire inventory.
** Cons: May have performance issues when encrypting/decrypting large amounts of data.
* **Alternative 2:** Only encrypt parts of the inventory user selects.
** Pros: More efficient in terms of performance (cuts down on encryption/decryption time).
** Cons: Add `encrypt` and `decrypt` command to allow user to choose what needs to be encrypted and decrypted respectively. Need to encrypt/decrypt different chunks of data correctly.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support data encryption

* **Alternative 1:** Save the entire inventory as encrypted data in the database.
** Pros: Data is secure and not viewable without encryption key.
** Cons: Implement log in page for decryption of inventory. Require alternative if encryption key is forgotten.
* **Alternative 2:** Save encrypted parts of inventory and plaintext in database.
** Pros: Able to salvage some information if encryption key is lost.
** Cons: Need to implement packing/unpacking of encrypted data and plaintext during startup/shutdown.

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::warningpanel[]
=== Warning Panel
==== Current Implementation

The `WarningPanel` is created as part of the `MainWindow`, to be displayed in the GUI. Within the panel are two lists, expiring/expired and low in stock, represented by `WarningListView` objects. The purpose of this feature is to allow the user to view expiring/expired medicine batches and low quantity medicines easily.

The following are some of the operations implemented:

* `Logic#getWarningPanelPredicateAccessor()` -- Returns a `WarningPanelPredicateAccessor`. This gives the caller access to all predicates used to filter lists for the warning panel in the current session.

* `WarningPanel#setUpVBox(ObservableList<Medicine>, ObservableList<Medicine>)` -- Sets up the `VBox` (vertical box) representing the warning panel by creating `WarningListView` objects from the `ObservableList` objects. Each `WarningListView` is a list to be displayed in the GUI.

===== Initialising the warning panel

Given below is how the warning panel GUI is initialised on start up.

Step 1. User launches MediTabs, invoking `MainWindow#fillInnerPart`. The `MainWindow` class calls `Logic#getExpiringMedicinesList`, `Logic#getLowStockMedicinesList` and `Logic#getWarningPanelPredicateAccessor` to obtain the two `ObservableList<Medicine>` to be displayed in the warning panel and the predicate accessor used in this session.

Step 2. The `WarningPanel` is initialised with the objects obtained in Step 1, and constructs a `VBox`.

Step 3. The `WarningPanel` self-invokes `setUpVBox` to populate the `VBox` with `WarningListView` objects for display. There will be two `WarningListView` objects, each initialised with its corresponding `ObservableList<Medicine>`, a list descriptor and the predicate accessor.

Step 4. The `WarningListView` configures a `ListView<Medicine>` object to display elements in the `ObservableList<Medicine>`. Every `ListView<Medicine>` cell is populated by a `WarningListViewCell` object.

Step 5. The `WarningListViewCell` listens to updates to the `ObservableList<Medicine>` that would update the medicines/batches to be displayed in the respective list in the warning panel.

The sequence diagram below summarises the above mentioned mechanism.

[[fig-WarningPanelSequenceDiagram]]
.Sequence diagram illustrating initialisation of the warning panel on start up
image::WarningPanelSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

===== Input handling

The basic flow of the `warning` command in two scenarios are as such:

====== To change a threshold used by the warning panel

Step 1. The user enters the command `warning e/10` to change the threshold for expiring medicine batches.

Step 2. The command is parsed and a `WarningCommand` object is created with the type and value of the new threshold to be set.

Step 3. The `WarningCommand#execute` method is invoked.

Step 4. Threshold for expiring medicine batches is changed.

Step 5. The expiring/expired batch list in the warning panel is updated accordingly.

Step 6. The new set of thresholds is shown in the result display box.

====== To display thresholds currently in use

Step 1. The user enters the command `warning show`.

Step 2. The command is parsed and a `WarningCommand` object is created to show current threshold levels.

Step 3. The `WarningCommand#execute` method is invoked.

Step 4. The current thresholds used are shown in the result display box.

The activity diagram below summarises what happens when the `warning` command is executed:

[[fig-WarningPanelActivityDiagram]]
.Activity diagram illustrating what happens when a user executes the `warning` command
image::WarningCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Construction of the lists displayed by the warning panel

Two `ObservableLists<Medicine>` objects are required, one to display medicine batches expiring soon and the other to display medicines low in stock.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create the `ObservableList<Medicine>` objects in the `ModelManager` by filtering the main medicine list, and have `MainWindow` obtain them via `Logic`.
** Pros: Easy to change predicates for filtration, making it possible to set user defined thresholds, thereby improving user experience.
** Cons: Requires passing the two lists around, from `ModelManager` to `Logic` then `MainWindow`.

* **Alternative 2:** Create the `ObservableList<Medicine>` objects in `Ui`.
** Pros: Simple to implement. Filter the main medicine list with the default predicates (i.e. thresholds for expiration and low stock) within `WarningPanel`.
** Cons: No separation of concerns. Not possible to set user defined thresholds for either list.

===== Aspect: Implementation of predicates used for the warning panel

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Singleton warning panel predicate accessor.
** Pros: Easy to access and update all warning panel-related predicates.
** Cons: Must pass the instance of the predicate accessor around to ensure there is only one instance of it at any time.

* **Alternative 2:** Save all predicates in the `ModelManager`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Predicate manipulation from `Logic` when new thresholds are set violates Dependency Inversion Principle.

// end::warningpanel[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// tag::validationoffilename[]
=== Validation of File Name

We are using the `seedu.address.commons.FileName` class which is created by our team for the validation of file name specified by the user. This is important for commands in MediTabs which supports the file name field.

[NOTE]
File name *does not* include file extension such as `.csv` and `.pdf`.

A list of reasons why we choose to create a `FileName` class for the validation of file name:

* There are currently no third party libraries available for validating file name to ensure that the file name is platform independent. In other words, there are no public methods to validate the file name specified by the user to ensure that it is supported on Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems.
[IMPORTANT]
There are certain naming conventions which have to be followed on Windows operating system which are not necessary on Linux and macOS operating systems. You can read more about the naming conventions for Windows link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file#naming-conventions[here]. You can also refer to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename#Comparison_of_filename_limitations[this] Wikipedia article for a detailed comparison between different naming conventions for different operating systems.
* Ensure consistency by creating a file naming convention.
* Ensure that files created with file names specified by the user can be used on Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems. This is to avoid potential bugs involving file names as MediTabs supports Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems hence, the user might switch between these operating systems when using MediTabs.

==== Current Implementation

The validation of file name mechanism is facilitated mainly by the `FileName#isValidFileName(String fileNameToCheck)` operation. The operation checks if the `fileNameToCheck` input is a valid file name based on the file naming convention we have created for MediTabs.

The file naming convention used in MediTabs is as follows: +
Format: `Start with an alphabet or number followed by alphabets, numbers, underscore or hyphen`

[NOTE]
In order to ensure that the validation of file name is platform independent, the validation is implemented such that it ensures that the specified file name not only follows the file naming convention used in MediTabs but also does not violate file naming conventions in any platform especially Windows which has a very strict file name conventions.

[IMPORTANT]
Based on manual testing by our team on Windows, it is discovered that `COM0` and `LPT0` are also part of the reserved names which are not allowed as file names in Windows. However, they are not reflected in the Windows documentation under the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file#naming-conventions[naming conventions] section. In order to ensure that `FileName` class validation implementation is platform independent, we have included `COM0` and `LPT0` as reserved names when validating the specified file name.

A full list of reserved names implemented in `FileName` class which are not allowed as file names is as follows:

* `CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM0, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT0, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9`

[NOTE]
The reserved names listed above are *case insensitive*, in other words, names such as `prn` or `CoM0` are also reserved names.

[WARNING]
The argument passed to the `fileNameToCheck` parameter of the `FileName#isValidFileName(String fileNameToCheck)` operation *must not* be an empty string or a null argument. If the argument passed is an empty string, the specified file name will be declared as invalid. If a null argument is passed, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown.

==== How to integrate it into new commands in MediTabs?

If you are a developer looking to add new features to MediTabs which involves the creation of files, we recommend integrating the existing `FileName` class. This can easily be done by making use of `FileName#isValidFileName(String fileNameToCheck)` operation.

You may wish to refer to the code snippet shown below, which is a modified version of the `ParserUtil#parseFileName(String fileName, boolean isEmptyFileNameAllowed)` operation used in MediTabs. The code snippet demonstrates how `FileName#isValidFileName(String fileNameToCheck)` operation can be used for easier reference.

[source,java]
----
public static FileName parseFileName(String fileName) throws ParseException {
    if (!FileName.isValidFileName(fileName)) { # <1>
        throw new ParseException(FileName.MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS); # <2>
    }
    return new FileName(fileName); # <3>
}
----
<1> Validate the specified file name using the `FileName#isValidFileName(String fileNameToCheck)` operation.
<2> If the specified file name is invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown.
<3> If the specified file name is valid, a `FileName` object constructed from the specified file name is returned.

[NOTE]
In the code snippet above, we have modified the method signature from `ParserUtil#parseFileName(String fileName, boolean isEmptyFileNameAllowed)` to `ParserUtil#parseFileName(String fileName)` and also its implementation for easier reference and understanding.

[IMPORTANT]
We *highly recommend* complementing the `FileName` class with Java build in classes such as link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/io/File.html[`java.io.File`] or link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html[`java.nio.file.Files`] and handling the exceptions thrown by the methods used in those classes when creating files with the validated file names. This is to allow potential exceptions involving but not limited to permissions, security and file name being too long which are outside the scope of `FileName` class to be handled.

Examples of commands in MediTabs which uses the `FileName` class to validate the specified file name:

* `export [FILE_NAME]`
* `label INDEX [f/FILE_NAME]`
// end::validationoffilename[]

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, MediTabs depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Non Functional Requirements

. User Constraints
.. The product caters users with a preference for typing commands over the command line. Only limited GUI interactions are available as the focus is on the command line interface.
.. The product is meant only for single user usage. i.e, any features (e.g. profile switching) should only be limited to a single user. Using such features to support multiple users is not recommended.

. Data
.. User should have read and write permissions for data stored on the local machine. i.e, expert users can edit the data file without the application.
.. Third party database management systems (e.g. MySQL, Postgres) are not permitted.

. Working Environment
.. The product should work on all mainstream OS.
.. Connection to external APIs is not recommended, although the usage of reliable external APIs is permissible. In such cases, a fallback should be implemented should the connection fail.

. Portability
.. The product should work without the need for additional software. `.jar` package will be used for the product release.

. Testability
.. Avoid implementing features that are difficult to test manually and automatically. i.e, avoid dependence on remote APIs as their behaviours are beyond our control.
.. Due to the project's constraints, audio related features were not taken into consideration. Avoid any features using audio indicators.
