== Introduction
Welcome to the Developer Guide for _Equipment Manager_!

_Equipment Manager_ is an application that allows engineers to keep track of the Preventive Maintenance schedule of all Resuscitation Devices in Singapore. It will help engineers to plan the number of equipment to carry out preventive maintenance, and also keep track on each equipment details such as status and location. +

Objectives of the application include:

* Providing commands such as search and filter to search and filter equipment serial number, equipment status or work list respectively.

* Displaying location of equipment in Google Maps.

* Planning the most efficient route to take for visiting multiple locations.


== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/equipment/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.equipment.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component shows webpages e.g. `DisplayGmap.html` hosted somewhere on the Internet. To host a webpage yourself, you may put your webpage into `\docs\staticpages`. All pages in `\docs\staticpages` will be copied to `gh-pages` branch and hosted on `gh-pages`.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `EquipmentManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an equipment).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master//src/main/java/seedu/equipment/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Equipment Manager data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Equipment Manager`, which `Equipment` can reference. This would allow `Equipment Manager` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Equipment` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/equipment/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Equipment Manager data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.equipment.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Filter feature

==== Introduction
We have implemented a `FilterCommand` that allow users to filter the current shown list with any fields.

The filter feature allow users to filter the current shown list with any fields, and can filter by multiple fields.

The `FilterCommand` is able to filter the shown list according to the user's preference at a time.

==== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter command works:

image::FilterCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the filter mechanism behaves at each step when filtering.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `filter /region north`

Step 3. After `EquipmentManagerParser` detects `filter` as the command word, a FilterCommandParser is created to parse
the arguments supplied to the command.

Step 4. The `FilterCommandParser` trims and splits the arguments by white spaces.

Step 5. Then, `EquipmentContainsKeywordsPredicate` checks that the equipment manager has either the respective serial
number, tags, address, name, email, phone.

Step 6. The argument is filtered against the predicate and returned to the GUI.

==== Design Considerations
*Implementation of `FilterCommand`*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** filter by specific field
** Pros: It is easy to implement and it is also consistent with how `FindCommand`
** Cons: The overall list is not 100% sorted by specific field
* **Alternative 2:** filter by tags
** Pros: It is more specific and more strictly
** Cons: More difficult to implement


// tag::sort[]
=== Sort feature

==== Introduction
We have implemented a `SortCommand` that allow users to sort the current shown list with any fields.

==== Current Implementation

`SortCommand` sorts the list by specified field in lexicographical order.

Step 1. The user launches the application and add equipment.

Step 2. The user executes `sort [FIELD]`

Step 3. The list is sorted by specified field and returned to the GUI.

Test cases:

- Input: `sort`

Output: By default, the list is sorted in alphabetical order of the client names.

- Input: `sort address`

Output: The list is sorted in alphabetical order.

- Input: `sort email`

Output: The list is sorted in alphabetical order.

- Input: `sort phone`

Output: The list is sorted in ascending order.



==== Design Considerations
*Implementation of `SortCommand`*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts by specific field.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Flexible to add more functions. Many JavaScript libraries can be used.
** Cons: The overall list is not 100% sorted by specific field
* **Alternative 2:** Sort by client name
** Pros: Overall list is sorted fully by client name
** Cons: Unable to sort other specific fields such as serial number of the equipment.

// tag::display[]
=== Display feature
The display feature allow users to view the location of all equipments in the current shown list on map.

==== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows how the display operation works:

image::DisplaySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 1. The user launches the application, the list of equipments will show in `UI` and stored in the `Model`.

Step 2. The user executes `display` command to show all the equipments on the map. The execution of `display` command will return a `CommandResult` indicating `display` which can be checked by `CommandResult#isDisplayMap()`. The `MainWindow` will check if the `CommandResult` is a display map command. Then `MainWindow#handleDisplayMap` will be called. `MainWindow#handleDisplayMap` will call `Logic#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the equipments list, and then call `Equipment#getCoordiantes()` on each equipments to get its coordinates.

Step 3. The `Equipment#getCoordiantes()` calls to `Google Map Geocoding API` with the address returned by `Equipment#getAddress()`. The API will return the coordinates of the address. This will be returned as the coordinates of the equipment.

[NOTE]
`Google Map Geocoding API` is not free to use. You need to have your own API key to use the API. You may check link:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding[`Google Map Platform - Geocoding Service`]

Step 4. The coordinates are constructed to form a URL and call a webpages in `BrowserPanel` to display the map. Currently the map is stord under `/docs/staticpages/` which will be copied and published by Travis CI robot to `github pages`. You may either use your own `github pages` URL by changing `BrowserPanel#MAP_PAGE_BASE_URL` to your own `github pages` URL, or use the current URL published by `CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3` team.

Step 5. The webpage receive the coordinates in parameter form. It will first parse the parameters. The standard form of parameters is `?coordinates=[[1.3012,103.1233], [1.4323, 103.2012]]&otherfields=["abc", "def"]`. The map may be extended to handle more functions, however the current parameter paraser can only handle parameters in the standard format. For now, only coordinates is used, other parameters will be ignored.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to display the base map
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate webpage, pass the coordinates as parameters.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Flexible to add more functions. Many JavaScript libraries can be used.
** Cons: Unexpected behaviors would happen if the WebEngine cannot display the webpage properly.
* **Alternative 2:** Use third party JavaFX map libraries.
** Pros: No unexpected behaviors, and more consistant running on different platforms.
** Cons: Harder to implement, less flexibility, and limit to extendsions.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedEquipmentManager`.
It extends `EquipmentManager` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `EquipmentManagerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedEquipmentManager#commit()` -- Saves the current equipment manager state in its history.
* `VersionedEquipmentManager#undo()` -- Restores the previous equipment manager state from its history.
* `VersionedEquipmentManager#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone equipment manager  state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, `Model#undoEquipmentManager()` and `Model#redoEquipmentManager()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedEquipmentManager` will be initialized with the initial equipment manager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single equipment manager state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete-e 5` command to delete the 5th equipment in the equipment manager. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, causing the modified state of the equipment manager after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `equipmentManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted equipment manager state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add-e n/Clementi CC ...` to add a new equipment. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, causing another modified equipment manager state to be saved into the `equipmentManagerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, so the equipment manager state will not be saved into the `equipmentManagerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the equipment was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoEquipmentManager()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous equipment manager state, and restores the equipment manager to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial equipment manager state, then there are no previous equipment manager states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoEquipmentManager()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoEquipmentManager()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the equipment manager to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `equipmentManagerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest equipment manager state, then there are no undone equipment manager states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoEquipmentManager()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the equipment manager, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`, `Model#undoEquipmentManager()` or `Model#redoEquipmentManager()`. Thus, the `equipmentManagerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitEquipmentManager()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `equipmentManagerStateList`, all equipment manager states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire equipment manager.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the equipment being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of equipment manager states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedEquipmentManager`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

All files under `\docs\staticpages\` will be copied to final output documentation folders as well. You may put any static pages you want to public to `\docs\staticpages`.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes

|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.equipment.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.equipment.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.equipment.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.equipment.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
