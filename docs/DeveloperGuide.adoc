== Introduction

=== What is QuickDocs

QuickDocs is an all in one solution where doctors can have greater control in facilitating patient consultations, organizing appointments,
and monitoring financial and inventory records in private clinics.

=== Purpose

The developer guide covers the software architecture, design decisions and implementation details of the features in QuickDocs.

=== Audience

This document aims to provide guidance for both software developers and software testers working on QuickDocs.

=== How to use the Developer Guide

Here are the notations used in the document:

[TIP]
This is a tip. Useful information pertaining to the features will be written here.
[NOTE]
This is a note. Additional information that further explains a feature will be written here. +
[WARNING]
This is a warning. Special information that requires additional attention to be paid will be written here to prevent operational issues from happening.

`filepath`, `command` and `method` are all formatted with a grey background. Example: `help`, `getCurrentConsultation()`
and `logic\LogicManager`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `w09.quickdocs.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture2.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/quickdocs//MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `padd ...` (values are not added for brevity).

.Component interactions for `addpat ...` command
image::SDforAddPatient.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::QDUiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/quickdocs/ui/RootLayoutController.java[`RootLayoutController.java`]

The UI aspect of QuickDocs is controlled by a single `rootLayoutController` that is responsible for handling the user interactions with
the interface. It is composed of the `resultDisplay`, `userInputField`, `inputFeedbackArea`, `reminderListPanel` and
the `currentSessionLabel` controls. +

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. RootLayout is defined in the matching `.fxml` file that is in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view[src/main/resources/view] folder.

.Overview of QuickDoc's user interface
image::uioverview.png[width="800"]

1. `resultDisplay` will reflect the results of the command entered
2. `userInputField` is where the user can enter their commands
3. Should the command fail due to erroneous command input, instructions to rectify the command will be displayed on the `inputFeedbackArea`
4. Appointments and Reminders are displayed on the `ReminderListPanel`. Appointments are coloured blue,
medicine alarms are coloured red and other reminders are coloured beige.
5. Current consultation sessions will be indicated on the `currentSessionLabel`.

Since the commands entered by the user is done through the user interface, the `UI` component interacts with  the
`Logic` specifically for the execution of commands. For details pertaining to the execution of commands, please refer to
the section on the <<Design-Logic>, logic component>>

The flow of how the interaction between the two components are as follows:

1. The user types the command line on the `userInputField` and presses `Enter`
2. The command line is sent to the `logic` component for execution
3. Any results or issues encountered during the process of execution will be returned from the `Logic` component to the `UI` component
4. `UI` will reflect the results or issues faced on the `resultDisplay` and the `inputFeedbackArea` respectively


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/quickdocs/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `QuickDocsParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("statistics 012019")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `statistics 012019` Command
image::StatisticsCommandSDForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The figure below describes the architecture of the model component of this application.

[[Model_diagram]]
.Structure of the Model Component
image::Model_diagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/quickdocs/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* consists of a QuickDocs object which contains all the data, and lists of managers of sub-modules retrieved from the QuickDocs object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `QuickDocs`,

* is the ultimate unit storing all sub-models and data for this application.
* is the class in charge of interacting with the storage component responsible for converting application data to files for storage.
* see <<Design-Storage, Storage Component>> for detailed explanation of the role of `QuickDocs` in Storage component.

The following sections illustrate the design of managers of each sub-module.

[[Design-Model-MedicineManager]]
==== Model for Medicine module

QuickDocs supports customized organization of medicine inventory. +

The figure below illustrates the implementation of the inventory system for medicine.

[[MedicineManager_diagram]]
.Structure of the MedicineManager
image::MedicineManager_diagram.png[width="800"]

In medicine module, information about a medicine is encapsulated into the `Medicine` class. +

`Directory` is a container for medicines, and sub-directories as well. +

The `MedicineManager` keeps a list of reference of all unique medicines in the storage, so that no two medicine in the storage could share the same name to avoid confusion. +

[NOTE]
All occurrences of medicines with the same name across different directories point to the same medicine in the list of unique medicine in MedicineManager.

As the directory-medicine structure resembles the tree data structure, it is possible to support tree-like operations, such as setting the same threshold for the "subtree" of a directory.

[[Design-Model-PatientManager]]
==== Model for Patient Management

The figure below illustrates how is a patient represented and how are patients are stored in QuickDocs.

[[PatientManager_diagram]]
.Structure of PatientManager
image::PatientManager_diagram.png[width='800']

A patient in QuickDocs consists of an address, name, NRIC, Contact, Email, Date of Birth, Gender and any number of tags. +

[NOTE]
Specially, no two patients in QuickDocs can share the same NRIC number. In other words, the patients in QuickDocs are easily identified with their unique NRIC numbers.

The `PatientManager` keeps a list of patients by chronological order of addition. PatientManager supports searching patients by NRIC, name and tags.

[[Design-Model-ConsultationManager]]
==== Model for ConsultationManager

The figure below illustrates how consultations with patients are recorded and organized in QuickDocs.

[[ConsultationManager_diagram]]
.Structure of ConsultationManager
image::ConsultationManager_diagram.png[width='800']

A `Consultation` in QuickDocs is defined to one patient and it consists of an optional `Diagnosis` and a list of `Prescription` of medicine. +

A diagnosis is then consisting of an assessment, the final conclusion of patient's illness, and a list of symptoms. +

Past consultations are kept as a list in `ConsultationManager`, and the manager supports listing consultations of the same patient by his/her NRIC.

[[Design-Model-RecordManager]]
==== Model for StatisticsManager

Every monetary transaction happened in the clinic, such as prescriptions to patients, is recorded by QuickDocs, and statistics report could be generated upon user requests. +

The figure below illustrates how such records are organized in QuickDocs, and how the statistics reports are generated. +

[[StatisticsManager_diagram]]
.Structure of StatisticsManager
image::StatisticsManager_diagram.png[width='800']

Monetary transactions in the clinics are categorized to two forms, i.e purchasing of medicine and revenue from consulting patients. +

Both forms have corresponding classes to record such transactions. Every successful execution of purchase medicine command and every successful consultation will create its corresponding record. +

`MonthStatistics` holds records of purchases of medicines and consultations happened in a particular month. +

The overall `StatisticsManager` has a list of MonthStatistics arranged in chronological order.

[[Design-Model-AppointmentManager]]
==== Model for AppointmentManager

The Appointment module manages time slots for appointment requests from the patients. +

The figure below illustrates how AppointmentManager is organized. +

[[AppointmentManager_diagram]]
.Structure of AppointmentManager
image::AppointmentManager_diagram.png[width='800]

A `Slot` is used to represent a time block during clinic's opening hour available for appointments. +

`Appointment` extends slot and each appointment is assigned exactly one patient. +

`AppointmentManager` holds a list of appointments which can then be operated on upon user commands.

[[Design-Model-ReminderManager]]
==== Model for ReminderManager

QuickDocs supports reminding our users about upcoming appointments and warns users about medicines that is low in stock. +

QuickDocs also supports customized reminders that could be set up by the users themselves. +

The figure below illustrates how reminder module is implemented.

[[ReminderManager_diagram]]
.Structure of ReminderManager
image::ReminderManager_diagram.png[width='800']

`Reminder` extends from slot, and has a starting date and end date. Users are free to customize reminders' title and comments for user-initiated reminders. +

`ReminderManager` keeps a list of reminders sorted by the date of reminder. Reminders that expires, i.e passed the end date, will automatically be hidden from the panel list of reminders shown to the user. +

Upon every subtraction or addition of medicine quantity in the inventory, the `ModelManager` calls the `ReminderManager` to check the sufficiency of medicine against the set threshold and update the reminder panel accordingly, so that the reminders for medicines in low stock is managed automatically upon every change in medicine quantity.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The `Storage` component of QuickDocs allows data to be saved and read from a json file.

==== Structure of the Storage Component
.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/quickdocs/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save all the QuickDocs data in json format into a single json file and read it back
** this json file contains 8 different lists, with each list consisting of only one of the 8 main `JsonAdapted` Class objects.

==== When does QuickDocs read your data?
All data are stored in a json file, with a default filepath `data/quickdocs.json`. This filepath can be
customised in the `preferences.json` file.

When QuickDocs is launched, all information in the `quickdocs.json` file will be read. As mentioned in the previous
section, the json file contains 8 different lists, and each list will have their information converted to their
corresponding model types by their respective `toModelType()` methods of the 8 different `JsonAdapted` classes.

These converted objects will then be added into their respective class managers.
As mentioned in the <<Design-Model, Model Component>> section, the `QuickDocs` class is responsible for storing
all these data as it holds all the different class managers.

Note that there are only 6 managers but there are 8 `JsonAdapted` classes. This is because converted
`JsonAdaptedStatistics` and `JsonAdaptedMonthStatistics` objects are both stored in the `StatisticsManager`.
Similarly, both `JsonAdaptedMedicine` and `JsonAdaptedDirectory` objects are stored in `MedicineManager`.

===== Starting QuickDocs with no data
If the `quickdocs.json` is not found, or contains any errors such that any information cannot be converted to its
corresponding model type, QuickDocs will be launched in a clean slate. If it is the case that the json file
is erroneous, it will not be deleted, however it will be overwritten if any saving occurs during the current session.

==== When does QuickDocs save your data?
QuickDocs saves data whenever there is modification of any information in the current session.

Note that the user mainly interacts with QuickDocs by executing commands, and only some user commands will modify
its data. For example, commands such as `listmed`, to list medicines, or `listapp`, to list appointments,
will not affect the data. However, commands such as `editpat`, to edit a patient's particulars, or `addapp`, to add
an appointment, will change the information stored in QuickDocs.

Hence, only methods that modifies data will indicate to the `QuickDocs` class that a modification occurred. All methods
that interact with the various class managers are contained in the `ModelManager` class, which holds a reference to
the main `QuickDocs` object and references to all class managers. The following are the steps taken when one of
these methods, in this case `Model#addApp()`, is called, which leads to data being saved:

. `Model#addApp()` adds the provided `Appointment` into `AppointmentManager`.
. `Model#addApp()` then calls `QuickDocs#indicateModification()`, providing the `boolean true` argument. This
indicates that a change in data has occurred, which did happened since a new `Appointment` object had been added.
. `LogicManager#execute()` checks if any modification occurred, through the `QuickDocs#isModified()` method, which
in this case returns `true`.
. `LogicManager#execute()` then saves the new modified QuickDocs data by calling `Storage#saveQuickDocs()`, providing
it with the `QuickDocs` object. The new modified data will now overwrite all data stored in the `quickdocs.json` file.

===== Design considerations
We chose this implementation to ensure that no data will be lost due to any unforeseen circumstances. For example,
if QuickDocs is closed unexpectedly, no data will be lost as any change in information has already been saved when
that modification occurred.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `quickdocs.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes the details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Patient management module

The patient management module consists of these commands:

1. adding a patient record `addpat`
2. editing a patient record `editpat`
3. deleting a patient record `deletepat`
4. listing a patient record (by name, nric, tags or index) `listpat`

The operations involved in the patient management modules involve the use of the `model\Patient\PatientManager.java`
class. The `PatientManager` maintains a list of patient records, which are loaded from the `quickdocs.json` file through the
<<Design-Storage, storage>> component.

==== Adding a patient

Patient records consist of `Name`, `NRIC`, `Email`, `Address`, `Contact`, `Gender`, `Dob` (Date of Birth) and `tagList` fields. The `addpat` command
require users to enter the value of these fields prepended by prefixes. The prefixes are used to separate the parameters and assign the
values to these fields.

image::dg-consultation/patientcreation.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
tagList can contain multiple or no tags at all.

==== Editing a patient

To edit a patient, a `PatientEditedFields` is first created. It consist of all the fields of a `Patient` object but all its values
are null initially. This means that only when the user enter a value for a specific field will it be assigned to the `PatientEditedFields`.

A temporary `Patient` object is then created with the values of the existing patient record to be edited. The `PatientEditedFields` will then
be checked against this temporary patient object and replace the fields which are non-null.

image::dg-consultation/patientediting.png[width="800"]

An additional check for NRIC will be done on the list of patient records to ensure that the editing of NRIC does not cause a conflict
with existing Patient records. When this additional check is passed, the temporary patient object will replace the existing patient record
designated for editing.

==== Deleting patient records

Each patient have a unique NRIC value. This is how QuickDocs differentiate between the different patient
records in the patient list in the `PatientManager` class.

To delete a patient record, the `deletepat` and a nric is specified. The patient list will be iterated and the record whose
NRIC matches the specified value will be removed.

==== Listing patient records

Since the patient records are stored in a list, their position in the list (index) can be used to view the details of a specific patient record.

The user can narrow down their patient record searches using the names, nric and tags assigned to each patient, and this results in a sublist
of patient records, with their index reflected to be shown on the main display of QuickDocs. The specific session can then be viewed by calling `listpat` along
with the index.

Internally, a `ListCommand` can
be created using four different constructors and each of them have a `constructedBy` field. The constructedBy field will indicate
whether the search is done by indexing, or filtering by name, nric or tags.

1. If indexing is used, `getPatientAtIndex()` is called during the execution of the List command to simply retrieve the record
in the patient list, at the position specified.

2. If name is used, `findPatientsByName()` will be called, and patient records whose names containing the sequence that the user entered will be retrieved.

3. If the nric is used, `findPatientsByNric()` is called and all patient records whose NRIC starts with the sequence supplied will be retrieved.

4. If tag is used, `findPatientsByTag` is called, retrieving all patient records tied with the tag specified.

Lastly, if `listpat` is called without any search parameters, QuickDocs will simply list the first 50 patients in the patient list.

=== Consultation management module

The consultation module consists of:

1. *The consultation process*
2. Listing of past patient <<consultation_records,consultation records>>

The listing of past patient consultation records is similar to the listing of patient records explained earlier, the only difference
being it can only be filtered down by NRIC and viewed using indexing.

The *consultation process* on the other hand, comprises of four stages: starting, diagnosis, prescribing and ending the consultation session.
It leverages on the actions done in the patient module and forms the bulk of the processes in the consultation module.

The following section will provide a more in-depth exploration of how the consultation process is implemented. This includes:

* The explanation of the design and mechanism behind the consultation process
* The decision making process of selecting the current implementation

==== Current Implementation for the consultation process

The consultation process comprises of four stages:

1. starting the consultation with a selected patient
2. entering the symptoms, assessment of the patient's current condition
3. entering the medicine to be prescribed
4. ending the consultation

The consultation process is facilitated by the `ConsultationManager.java` class.
The ConsultationManager class holds the current consultation session and a list of past
consultation records for every patients.

Methods in the ConsultationManager comprises of:

* `createConsultation(Patient)` -- Starts a consultation session with the current selected patient
* `diagnosePatient(Diagnosis)` -- Record symptoms patient mentioned and the assessment of the current condition.
* `prescribeMedicine(List of Prescriptions)` -- Prescribe the medicine and the quantities to be administered.
* `endConsultation()` -- Ends the consultation session. No further edits can be made to both prescription and diagnosis.

Both `diagnosePatient` and `prescribeMedicine` are repeatable. The values entered during the repeated command will simply replace
the existing diagnosis / prescription.

[NOTE]
QuickDocs only permit one ongoing consultation. During diagnosis and prescription, changes are only made to the current consultation
session. The previous consultations should not be edited to prevent falsification of medical records. The current consultation session
can only end after both the diagnosis and prescription are finalized.

Given below is an example usage scenario:



*Step 1.* A previously registered patient arrives and the doctor starts the session by
entering the consult command in this manner: `consult r/NRIC of the patient`. A message to indicate
the start of the consultation will be shown in the results display.

* if the patient is new and his or her details are not recorded in QuickDocs, the command will not be executed and the doctor will be alerted
that the consultation cannot continue since no patient records with the entered Nric can be found. An invalid nric entered will also prompt the
same response

image::dg-consultation/consultation1.png[width="800"]

*Step 2.* The patient will tell the doctor what are his / her ailments. The doctor will record the symptoms
down. The doctor will then make the assessment of the illness the patient is having and execute the command by clicking
on the `Enter` on the keyboard.

* The symptoms and assessment have to be prepended by the `s/` and `a/` prefix respectively
* The command entered by the doctor will look something like this: `diagnose s/constant coughing s/sore throat a/throat infection`

image::dg-consultation/consultation2.png[width="800"]

*Step 3.* Should the patient inform the doctor of additional symptoms after the diagnosis is given, the doctor can simply press
the up and down key to display the previously entered command on the userInput area. The doctor can then add the new symptom in and
press `Enter`, replacing the previously recorded diagnosis.

image::dg-consultation/consultation3.png[width="800"]

*Step 4.* The doctor will then add the medicine to the prescription list, followed by the quantities. Medicine are prepended by the `m/` prefix while
quantities are prefixed by `q/`.The order of the quantity entered corresponds with the order the medicine is added in the command:

* `prescribe m/Dextromethorphan m/ibuprofen q/1 q/2` In this case q/1 represents one unit of Dextromethorphan cough syrup is issued while
2 units of ibuprofen (inflammatory tablets) are issued to the patient
* Alternatively, the doctor can enter the quantity right after the medicine: `prescribe m/Dextromethorphan q/1 m/ibuprofen q/2`

If any of the medicine issued are insufficient to complete the prescription, or is simply not in the inventory, a message will be displayed in
the inputFeedback area. The command will not be executed and remains in the userInput text field. The doctor can then make the changes to the command.

image::dg-consultation/consultation4.png[width="800"]

*Step 5.* Just like the diagnosis command, prescription can be replaced by reentering the command.

image::dg-consultation/consultation5.png[width="800"]

*Step 6.* After explaining the medicine intake to the patient, the doctor can then end the consultation session on QuickDocs by using the command
`endconsult`. No further changes to the consultation records can be made from this point on.

The following sequence diagrams summarizes what happens when a user perform the entire consultation process, starting with the session initialisation:

image::dg-consultation/consultationSD1.png[width="800"]

Followed by the adding of the diagnosis:

image::dg-consultation/diagnosisSD.png[width="800"]

prescribing the medicine to tackle the patient's condition:

image::dg-consultation/prescriptionSD.png[width="800"]

finally, saving the consultation record into QuickDocs:

image::dg-consultation/endconsultSD.png[width="800"]


==== Design considerations

1. In a neighbourhood clinic setting, doctors usually tend to only one patient at a time. This is why QuickDocs only allow a single
ongoing session in the consultation process.

2. In Singapore, every person is given a unique NRIC / FIN number regardless of their citizenship statuses. As such the NRIC is used to
search for the patient records to start the consultation session.

3. The prescription and diagnosis commands are made to override their previous states to ease the modification of consultation data.
Doctors can simply use the command history to navigate to the previous command entered, make the changes and then execute the command. This
allow them to simply add a few words to change consultation data rather than re-entering the entire command line.

4. Prescription can actually be added before the diagnosis is recorded. The doctor could be expecting a patient for regular checkup and prepare the
prescription before the patient enters the room. If the condition remains the same as before, the doctor can simply enter the diagnosis to complete the
consultation session, cutting down the time spent on the consultation session.

==== Alternatives considered

Prior to the current implementation, a few options for the overall consultation process was considered:

[cols="1,2a,1, 1", options="header"]
|===
|Alternative |Description |Pros | Cons
// row 1
|*Consultation as one single command*
|Doctor enter `consult` followed by all the symptoms, assessment, prescriptions
 and then execute
| Consultation is now restricted to just one class

The consultation creation will truly be one-shot
|

Input will be verbose, easy for the doctor to make mistakes

Harder to spot and navigate to the erroneous part to make changes

No room for the doctor to make changes as the consultation could have ended with erroneous information recorded
// row 2
|*Iterative consultation creation*
|Doctor enter `consult`.

Doctor get prompted to enter symptoms and assessment.

Doctor get prompted to enter prescription.

Consultation is ended once prescription is recorded
| Less likely to enter erroneous data as consultation is now broken down to different stages

| The consultation will take a longer time to be completed

Doctor can only diagnose and prescribe during the session, while other related actions
(such as listing past records) can only be done after the consultation

// row 3
| *Separate commands for start, diagnose, prescribe and end*

*(Chosen implementation)*
|
Doctors begin and end session with `consult` and `endconsult`.

Prescriptions and diagnosis can be added or replaced using the `diagnose` and `prescribe` commands before the session ends.
| The editing involve the replacement of the current diagnosis or prescription entry, commands can be reused to perform both
add and edit operations.

Editing remain one shot and fast as users can make use of the command history to make changes to a previously entered command to
make changes.

Flexibility in recording consultation details, instead of having to go through the start, diagnose, prescribe, end order
strictly.

Room for other commands to be executed while a session is ongoing.

|
Potentially more commands will be called when compared to the other options.

diagnosis and prescription commands entered could be verbose and doctors can make mistakes easily.

| *Fragment diagnosis and prescription commands even more*
| Same as the third alternative, but there are commands specific to the adding of symptoms in diagnosis, adding of medicine in prescription.

Separate commands for editing the symptoms added or medicine prescribed
|
Shorter commands to add symptoms or prescribe medicine. Less mistakes will be made.

Doctors only need to edit specific entries instead of retyping or navigating to previously entered command and make changes.

|
Way more commands to be entered by users.

Even more commands and methods to be written, there will be a higher possibility of bugs arising from the increase in
code volume.

|===

Although the selected option require more input and lengthier commands, it guarantees the flexibility and efficiency QuickDocs
aim to deliver for doctors in neighbourhood clinics.

These are some of the considerations taken before the decision was made:

1. Since QuickDocs aim to provide a single interface for doctors to perform clinical operations more efficiently, the consultation
process will require one shot commands to fulfill the efficiency requirement of the overall product.

2. It is highly possible for doctors to make mistakes with the one-shot commands, especially when there are so many parameters involved
in a single command. Therefore the implementation must provide a convenient form of error recovery.

3. There could be interleaving operations between the modules, such as viewing past consultation records or
checking medicine inventory in the midst of the consultation. The implementation must be flexible enough
to allow cross module commands during a consultation.

Although the selected option require more user input and involve lengthier commands, a doctor with fast typing speed will be able to
circumvent the issues of slightly more verbose command lines easily.

If the doctor enters an erroneous command or simply want to make changes, the command history can be used in conjunction with the
one shot commands to make changes quickly.

The selected option also do not restrict doctors to just consultation-related commands. He or she can perform other operations such as checking the inventory
or view free appointment slots during the consultation itself.

The selected implementation guarantees the flexibility and efficiency that
QuickDocs aim to deliver for doctors in neighbourhood clinics.

=== Appointment management module
The Appointment module provides the user with greater control over his/her scheduled appointments by organising them
neatly and preventing any clash of appointment timings. Listed below are the commands that the appointment module features:

. Adding an appointment, `addapp`
. Listing appointments, `listapp`
. Deleting an appointment, `deleteapp`
. Listing free appointment slots, `freeapp`

These features are supported by the `AppointmentManager` class, which stores all created appointments in an `ArrayList`.
On QuickDocs launch, existing appointments are read from the `quickdocs.json` file through the <<Design-Storage, storage>> component.

[[app]]
==== Appointments
An `Appointment` is a subclass of the `Slot` class, and has the following 5 compulsory fields:

* `Patient patient` - the patient who made this appointment
* `LocalDate date` - the date of this appointment
* `LocalTime start` - the time this appointment starts
* `LocalTime end` - the time this appointment ends
* `String comment` - any other details for this appointment

[[addapp]]
==== Adding an appointment
The user can add an appointment to his/her schedule to keep track of future meetings, by using the `addapp` command.
All 5 fields of an appointment, as mentioned in the <<app, Appointments>> section, must be specified together with
the command.

===== Input validation
These fields are parsed by the `AddAppCommandParser` class, creating an `AddAppCommand` object, which then carries out
the following steps before adding the appointment into QuickDocs:

. Retrieve the `patient`, if he/she exists, by calling `Model#getPatientByNric()`.
Note that the user specifies the `patient` of the appointment by providing the patient's NRIC, hence the need for this step.
. Check if the `start` and `end` timings are valid. The appointment timing has to be within office hours (9am to 6pm)
and the `start` time must not be after or equal to the `end` time.
. Create the appointment using the given fields and check if this appointment has any conflict in timing with other
existing appointments, by calling `Model#hasTimeConflicts()`.
. Finally, add the appointment into `AppointmentManager` by calling `Model#addApp()`.

[NOTE]
If any of the steps 1 to 3 fails, a `CommandException` will be thrown and the corresponding exception message will
be shown to the user.

===== Adding the appointment into AppointmentManager
Listed below are the steps taken when the `Model#addApp()` method is called. Note that
when an appointment is added, a reminder tailored for this appointment will also be added. This was implemented to
ensure that the user does not forget about the appointment in the future.

. Add the given appointment into the `AppointmentManager` by calling its `addAppointment()` method.
* `AppointmentManager#addAppointment()` takes in the appointment to be added and adds it into the `ArrayList` of
appointments in its sorted position. This ensures that this list of appointments is always sorted by date and time,
with the earliest appointment at the start of the list.
. Create a reminder tailored to this appointment by calling `Model#createRemFromApp()`.
. Add the newly created reminder into the `ReminderManager` by calling `Model#addRem()`.

[NOTE]
You can learn more about reminders in the <<reminder-module, Reminder management module>> section.

All these steps that are executed when the `addapp` command is called can be summarized in the
Sequence Diagrams shown below:

.Sequence diagram when `addapp` is called
image::dg-appointment/addapp_SD.png[width="800"]

{sp} +

.Sequence diagram reference: add appointment to AppointmentManager
image::dg-appointment/addapp_SD_ref.png[width="800"]

==== Listing appointments
The user can list his/her past or future appointments using the `listapp` command. The user can either provide a range
of dates to list out all appointments in those dates, or provide an NRIC to list out all appointments for the patient
with the given NRIC.

[NOTE]
If the user does not specify a `FORMAT` and `DATE`, `FORMAT` will default to `week` and `DATE` will default to the
current date, meaning that the current week's appointments will be displayed.

[[listapp]]
===== Listing by dates
The user can specify the range of dates by providing a `FORMAT` (`day`, `week`, or `month`) and a `DATE`, which means to
list all appointments on the `FORMAT` (day/month/week) of `DATE`. The following steps will then be taken:

. The `ListAppCommandParser` class parses these two parameters into `LocalDate start` and `LocalDate end`, and creates a
`ListAppCommand` object. `start` and `end` represents the start and end dates of the range of dates of appointments
to be listed.
. `ListAppCommand` will then be executed, calling `Model#listApp()`, providing it with the `start` and `end` dates.
. `Model#listApp()` then calls `AppointmentManager#listAppointments()`, with the same 2 arguments, which will return a
`String` of all appointment information within the given range of dates.

===== Listing by patient's NRIC
In this case, the user only provides the NRIC of a patient together with the `listapp` command. The following steps
will then be taken:

. The `ListAppCommandParser` class parses the user input into an `NRIC` object, creating a `ListAppCommand` object with this
`NRIC` field.
. `ListAppCommand` executes:
* Firstly, it retrieves the patient with the provided `NRIC`, if exists, by calling `Model#getPatientByNric()`.
* `Model#listApp()` will then be called, providing it with the patient retrieved.
. `Model#listApp()` then calls `AppointmentManager#listAppointments()`, providing it with the patient, which returns
a `String` of all the given patient's appointment information.

[NOTE]
`Model#listApp()` and `AppointmentManager#listAppointments()` are overloaded methods, having different method
signatures based on their parameters. One implementation takes in two `LocalDate` parameters, `start` and `end`, while
the other implementation takes in a single `Patient` object. This allows the same method name to be called, and list
appointments by either providing a range of dates or a valid patient respectively.

[[deleteapp]]
==== Deleting appointments
The user can delete any appointments created using the `deleteapp` command. Since there cannot be any clash in timings
for appointments, any appointment can be identified uniquely by its date and start time. Hence the user can specify
the appointment to be deleted only with those two fields, after which the following steps are taken:

. The `DeleteAppCommandParser` class parses the two parameters into `LocalDate date` and `LocalTime start` that specifies
the date and start time of the appointment to be deleted respectively. It then creates a `DeleteAppCommand` object with
these two fields.
. `DeleteAppCommand` executes:
* Firstly, it checks if `start` is a valid timing, checking if it is within office hours (9am to 6pm).
* Next, it retrieves the specified appointment, if it exists, by calling `Model#getAppointment()`, providing it
with `date` and `start`.
* Finally, `Model#deleteAppointment()` is called, providing it with the appointment retrieved.
. `Model#deleteAppointment()` then calls `AppointmentManager#deleteAppointment()`, providing it with the appointment.
`AppointmentManager#deleteAppointment()` will then remove the appointment from the `ArrayList` of appointments stored
in `AppointmentManager`.

==== Free appointment slots
Before deciding on an appointment timing, the user can execute the `freeapp` command to list out all the timings available for
a new appointment booking.

===== Command format: `freeapp f/FORMAT d/DATE`
We can see that the `freeapp` command takes in two parameters: +

. `FORMAT`: can be `day`, `week`, or `month` +
. `DATE`: a valid date

This command can be roughly translated to: +
_"Search for free appointment slots on the `FORMAT` (day/month/week) of `DATE`."_

The `FreeAppCommandParser` class will parse these two parameters into two dates, `LocalDate start` and `LocalDate end`,
representing the start and end dates of the search range for free appointment slots. `FreeAppCommandParser` then
constructs a `FreeAppCommand` object with the `start` and `end` fields.

[NOTE]
If the user does not specify a `FORMAT` and `DATE`, `FORMAT` will default to `month` and `DATE` will default to the
next month's date, meaning that free appointment slots for the whole of the following month will be displayed.

===== Current Implementation
The search is facilitated by the `AppointmentManager` class which stores all created `Appointments` in an `ArrayList`.
`AppointmentManager` contains the method `listFreeSlots()` which firstly calls `AppointmentManager#getFreeSlots()`.
`getFreeSlots()` is the main method that implements the logic behind `freeapp`.

Given below are the steps taken when `listFreeSlots()` is called.

Step 1. The method `listFreeSlots()` takes in the two arguments, `start` and `end`, which have been mentioned previously.
Firstly, `listFreeSlots()` calls `getFreeSlots()`, providing it with the same two arguments, to retrieve a `List` of
free `Slots` before it can parse them into a `String`.

.Given search range from start to end date
image::dg-appointment/freeapp1.png[width="800"]

{sp} +
Step 2. In `getFreeSlots()`, we first retrieve the existing appointments that are within this given search range
by using the method `AppointmentManager#getAppointments()`.

.Retrieved appointments in the search range
image::dg-appointment/freeapp2.png[width="800"]

{sp} +
Step 3. Next, we look at all the appointments that are present on the `start` date, as shown in the diagram below.
These appointments are sorted by date and time, with the earliest appointment on the left and the latest on the right.

.Selected appointments on start date
image::dg-appointment/freeapp3.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Since the appointments are already sorted, we do not need to search through the whole appointment list to
find appointments present on the `start` date. We can simply go through the list from the beginning
until we reach an appointment date that is not equals to `start`.

{sp} +
Step 4. We fill in each empty 'gap' between any two appointments by creating a `Slot` object.

Each `Slot` object represents a single time period on a single date. It has three attributes: +

* `LocalDate date` - the date of this time slot.
* `LocalTime start` - the start time of this time slot.
* `LocalTime end` - the end time of this time slot.

In this `freeapp` context, these slots created represents a time period without any scheduled appointments.

.Slots created to fill in empty time slots
image::dg-appointment/freeapp4.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Slots will only be created for timings during office hours (09:00 to 18:00). This is to prevent any possible
inconvenience caused if the user accidentally decides on a timing outside of office hours.
(Even though there will be an office hour constraint when the user eventually creates the appointment.)

{sp} +
Step 5. We repeat Steps 3 and 4, replacing the `start` date with the remaining dates until the `end` date.
All slots created will be added into an `ArrayList` of free slots, `freeSlots`.

.All empty time slots filled
image::dg-appointment/freeapp5.png[width="800"]

{sp} +
Step 6. After all the slots are added, we return `freeSlots` to the caller function `listFreeSlots()`,
to generate a `String` that represents all the free slots to be appended onto the main display of the UI.

{sp} +

We can summarize the steps taken after the `freeapp` command is called in the Sequence Diagram below:

.Sequence diagram when `freeapp` is called
image::dg-appointment/freeapp_SD.png[width="800"]


===== Design Considerations
Listed below are some of the considerations we took when designing the `freeapp` command.

1. This feature was implemented for the convenience of the user in choosing a valid appointment slot with his/her patient.
It is more intuitive to decide on an appointment slot based on all the empty slots shown, rather than listing out
all existing appointments using `listapp` and then figuring out what timings are available from there.

2. We require the user to specify the search range by listing the `FORMAT` and `DATE` instead of the the `start` and
`end` dates directly, to make the command more user friendly. The user does not have to be bothered with the exact
range of dates to search, and can simply specify a rough date and be provided with information for the neighbouring
dates if the `FORMAT` given is `week` or `month`. Moreover, if the user wants to list all free slots for the whole
month, they do not have to check what the last date of the month is in order to specify the end date.

===== Alternatives Considered
Listed below are the methods considered to implement the `freeapp` command.

[cols="1,2,2,3", options="header"]
|===
|Alternative |Description |Pros | Cons
// row 1
|*Maintain a permanent list of free slots*
|Maintain a list of free slots for a pre-determined range (e.g. next three months) instead of creating a new list
every time `appfree` is called.
|It will be quicker to search for free slots as the list is already created. We simply need to filter the list
with the given search range and print out the resulting filtered slots.
|Tedious work needs to be done to maintain this permanent list of free slots, as it has to be modified whenever an
appointment is added or deleted.

Also, if the given search range is not within the range of this consistent list of free slots,
this list will still have to be created from scratch, defeating the purpose of maintaining this permanent list.
// row 2
|*Generate free slots only when required*

(Chosen implementation)
|We will only generate a list of free slots when the `freeapp` command is called. This list will be a one-time use
only and will not be stored in QuickDocs storage.
|The user is given the flexibility to specify the range of dates to list the free slots, as this list is generated
on the spot, and is not limited to the dates of a pre-determined list.
|Since the generated list of free slots is not stored, extra work will be done in generating the same free slots
when the next `freeapp` is called, that has a range of dates which overlaps the previous `freeapp` dates.
|===

We decided to implement the second method, as it is more straightforward. Here are the reasons why: +

. The first implementation is actually just an extension of the chosen implementation as it still requires a way
to generate a list of free slots, either when QuickDocs is launched or when the user requests a search range outside
of the pre-determined list.
. The first implementation additionally requires more effort to maintain this permanent list whenever the
list of appointments is modified, which is not straightforward to implement. For example, we need a method to merge
two free slots when an appointment is deleted, and another method to split a free slot into two when an appointment
is added.
. The benefit of a permanent list of free slots is the quicker execution time of `freeapp`, which will typically
only be called a small number of times (around 10) a day, when the user books an appointment slot with his/her patient.
The total time saved on executing `freeapp` a small number of times is therefore negligible.
. QuickDocs already has plenty of data to be stored, such as appointments, consultations and medicine records.
The minimal benefits that a permanent list of free slots provide does not justify its additional storage cost.

[[reminder-module]]
=== Reminder management module
The Reminder module provides the user with a way to keep track of future tasks, to-dos, or appointments. The reminders
will be displayed on the reminder side bar, and are colour coded as such:

* [blue]#Blue#: Reminder for a scheduled appointment
* [red]#Red#: Reminder to stock up on a medicine
* [yellow]#Beige#: Any other personal reminders

Listed below are the commands that the reminder module features:

. Adding a reminder, `addrem`
. Listing reminders, `listrem`
. Deleting a reminder, `deleterem`

These features are supported by the `ReminderManager` class, which stores all created reminders in an `ArrayList`.
On QuickDocs launch, existing reminders are read from the `quickdocs.json` file through the
<<Design-Storage, storage>> component.

[[rem]]
==== Reminders
A `Reminder` is a subclass of the `Slot` class, and has the following 5 fields:

* `String title` - the title/header for this reminder
* `LocalDate date` - the date for this reminder
* `LocalTime start` - the start time for this reminder
* `LocalTime end` - the end time for this reminder
* `String comment` - any other details for this reminder

Only the `title`, `date` and `start` attributes are compulsory fields for a reminder.

==== Adding a reminder
The user can take note of a task to do by creating a reminder using the `addrem` command. As mentioned in the
<<rem, Reminders>> section, only the `title`, `date` and `start` attributes are compulsory fields and must be
specified together with the `addrem` command. Fields `end` and `comment` are optional. Below are the steps taken
after the user executes the `addrem` command.

. The `AddRemCommandParser` class parses the user input into 3 to 5 `Reminder` fields.
. The `Reminder` object is constructed by the parser with the given fields.
. An `AddRemCommand` object is created, providing it with the reminder object to be added.
. `AddRemCommand` executes:
* Firstly, it checks if there is a duplicate reminder using the `Model#duplicateRem()` method, which subsequently
calls `ReminderManager#hasDuplicateReminder()`.
* If there are no duplicates, `Model#addRem()` is called, providing it with the given reminder.
. `Model#addRem()` then calls `ReminderManager#addReminder()`, providing it with the given reminder.
`ReminderManager#addReminder()` will then add the reminder into the `ArrayList` of reminders stored
in `ReminderManager`.

[NOTE]
The added reminder will only appear on the reminder sidebar if the date of the reminder is within the range of dates
that the sidebar is currently displaying. More information can be found in the next section, <<listrem, Listing Reminders>>.

===== Automatic generation of reminders
Some reminders will be created and added automatically.

. Appointment reminders
* When an appointment is added, a reminder for this appointment will be generated automatically.
More information can be found in the <<addapp, adding an appointment>> section.
. Low medicine alarm reminders
* The user is able to set a threshold for each medicine in the inventory by using the `alarm` command. When the quantity
of a medicine drops below its threshold, a reminder will be created to alert the user of the low medicine quantity. More
information can be found in the <<med, medicine implementation>> section.

[[listrem]]
==== Listing reminders
The reminders displayed on the reminder sidebar can be filtered using the `listrem` command.

===== Displaying reminders on the sidebar
Similar to the <<listapp, `listapp`>> command, the user can specify a range of dates by providing a `FORMAT`
(`day`, `week`, or `month`) and a `DATE`, which means to display all reminders on the `FORMAT` (day/month/week) of `DATE`.
The following steps will then be taken:

. The `ListRemCommandParser` class parses these two parameters into `LocalDate start` and `LocalDate end`, and creates a
`ListRemCommand` object. `start` and `end` represents the start and end dates of the range of dates of reminders
to be displayed on the sidebar.
. `ListRemCommand` executes:
* Firstly, a `ReminderWithinDatesPredicate` object will be created with the given `start` and `end` dates.
This predicate is used to update the `FilteredList` of reminders contained in the `ModelManager` class.
* Next, `Model#updateFilteredReminderList()` is called, providing it with the created predicate.
. The `FilteredList` of reminders will be updated to match the range of dates given and the reminder sidebar is updated.

[NOTE]
If the user does not specify a `FORMAT` and `DATE`, `FORMAT` will default to `week` and `DATE` will default to the
current date, meaning that the current week's reminders will be displayed.

[[listrem_single]]
===== Display a single reminder
The `listrem` command can also be used to display the details of a single reminder onto the main display. This is useful
when the `title` or `comment` of a reminder is too long to be displayed fully on the sidebar. The user can do so by
providing the index of the reminder, as shown in the sidebar, together with the `listrem` command.

. The `ListRemCommandParser` class parses the user input into an `Index` object, and creates a `ListRemCommand` object
consisting of the `Index` field.
. `ListRemCommand` executes:
* Firstly, it retrieves the currently displayed `List` of reminders by calling `Model#getFilteredReminderList()`.
* Next, it checks if the given `Index` is valid, checking if the `Index` is present in the current `List`
of reminders.
* If the `Index` given is valid, the reminder to be displayed is retrieved using the `List#get()` method on the `List`
of reminders.
. The information of the selected reminder is then appended onto the main display of the UI.

Displaying a single reminder can also be done by clicking on the reminder in the sidebar with a mouse. This feature
is supported by the `ReminderListPanel` class which is a UI component for the reminder sidebar. It contains the
`Node#setOnMouseClicked()` method that takes in an `EventHandler`, which is specified to display the reminder
details when the reminder is clicked.

==== Deleting a reminder
Deleting a reminder is simple, as the user only needs to specify the index of the reminder shown on the sidebar,
together with the `deleterem` command. The process, when `deleterem` is called, described below is similar to the
process when `listrem` is called to <<listrem_single, display a single reminder>>.

. The `DeleteRemCommandParser` class parses the user input into an `Index` object, and creates a `DeleteRemCommand`
object consisting of the `Index` field.
. `DeleteRemCommand` executes:
* Firstly, it retrieves the currently displayed `List` of reminders by calling `Model#getFilteredReminderList()`.
* Next, it checks if the given `Index` is valid, checking if the `Index` is present in the current `List`
of reminders.
* If the `Index` given is valid, the reminder to be deleted is retrieved using the `List#get()` method on the `List`
of reminders.
* `Model#deleteReminder()` is called, providing it with the reminder to be deleted.
. `Model#deleteReminder()` subsequently calls `ReminderManager#delete()` to delete the given reminder from the
`ArrayList` of reminders stored in `ReminderManager`.

[NOTE]
Reminders are automatically created when an appointment is added, as mentioned <<addapp, here>>. However, when the
reminder of an appointment is deleted, the appointment will NOT be deleted. Use the <<deleteapp, `deleteapp`>> command
to delete an appointment.

=== Record & Statistics feature ===
==== Current implementation ====
The statistics command is started through the command `stats START_MMYY [END_MMYY]`.
The two MMYY corresponds to a range of dates. The end range is optional,

=== Administrative and Statistics Module
The administrative and statistics module currently consists of 2 commands: +

1. setting the consultation fee `setconsultfee` +
2. querying the statistics `statistics` +

This 2 commands makes use of the classes located in filepath `model\record`.

==== Consultation fee
The consultation fee of the clinic is stored as a BigDecimal in the StatisticsManager of QuickDocs, which is loaded from the
quickdocs.json file through the <<Design-Storage, storage>> component. The consultation fee is used for calculating
financial statistics for any ConsultationRecord objects.

==== Querying statistics
The statistics command is started through the command `stats START_MMYYYY [END_MMYYYY]`.
The two MMYYYY corresponds to a range of dates. The end range is optional,
and is defaulted to the start range by the StatisticsCommandParser if it does not exist. +

The start date is not allowed to be before January 2019, and the end date cannot be before the start date. Hence,
QuickDocs currently does not support adding old records before January 2019 due to the implementation of the
StatisticsManager. This will be explained in the section below. +
[NOTE]
MMYYYY is a string, e.g. "012019", which stands for January 2019. It is parsed by StatisticsCommandParser into a
YearMonth object. +

==== Statistics and Record - Current Implementation

The statistics class stores 6 types of information: +

1. Number of consultations +
2. Medicines prescribed +
3. Symptoms diagnosed +
4. Revenue +
5. Expenditure +
6. Profit +

Number of consultations is stored as an int, while the financial variables are stored using BigDecimals. The number of
medicines prescribed and symptoms diagnosed are stored by using a HashMap. +

[NOTE]
Implementation of additional statistics will be done through adding additional relevant variable fields.

The implementation of Statistics and Record has 3 parts: +

1. Creation of the Record +
2. Adding the Record +
3. Retrieving the Statistics +

===== 1. Creation of the Record
In order for the statistics to be keep tracked of, Record objects are used to retrieve information that the
StatisticsManager will make use of. The Record class is an abstract class that only has 1 abstract method,
`toStatistics(StatisticsManager sm)`, which will generate a Statistics object.
Each child class of Record is for a specific operation in QuickDocs, where the implementation
`toStatistics(StatisticsManager sm)` will generate a Statistics object that stores relevant information pertaining to
that specific operation. The StatisticsManager is passed in to retrieve the any variable that the Record might require
to calculate the statistics, e.g., ConsultationRecord requires the consultationFee variable in StatisticsManager.

Currently, there are only 2 child classes of Record, ConsultationRecord and MedicinePurchaseRecord. ConsultationRecords
are created when the a consultation session ends from the EndConsultCommand, while MedicinePurchaseRecord are created
when a medicine is purchased via the PurchaseMedicineCommand. The commands will create the Record, and call ModelManager's
`addRecord(record, clock)` function, which will then result in ModelManager calling StatisticsManager's `record(record, clock)`
function. The clock used is the system clock, to retrieve the current YearMonth of the Record created. The sequence diagram
below illustrates an example ConsultationRecord being created.

.Sequence diagram for sample ConsultationRecord creation
image::RecordCreationSD.png[width="800"]

===== 2. Adding the record
The StatisticsManager holds an ArrayList of MonthStatistics, where a MonthStatistics object contains the YearMonth, and
the Statistics object of that YearMonth. Each MonthStatistics object will be initialised with the zero Statistics object,
where all the variables are 0 or contains no elements (not null). The ArrayList starts with a MonthStatistics with the
YearMonth 2019 January, and every subsequent index will contain the MonthStatistics with the subsequent month, e.g.,
the 4th index contains the MonthStatistics with YearMonth 2019 May.

When the StatisticsManager adds a new Record by the `record(record, clock)` function, it will first retrieve the
YearMonth from the `clock` variable passed in. Next, it will update the size of the ArrayList by calling its own method
`updateListSize(clock)`, which is a wrapper for `updateListSize(YearMonth)`. Afterwards, StatisticsManager will find the
correct index of the MonthStatistics ArrayList to add the record in. In the current implementation, the record is not
actually stored. Instead, the record will be converted to a Statistics object which is then merged with the
MonthStatistics's own Statistics object. The MonthStatistics's Statistics object will then be reassigned with the newly
merged Statistics object. The sequence diagram below illustrates an example ConsultationRecord being added.

.Sequence diagram for adding a sample ConsultationRecord
image::SDForAddingRecords.png[width="800"]

===== 3. Retrieving the Statistics

When the StatisticsCommand queries for the statistics for a range
of months, Logic will call the ModelManager's `getStatistics(FROM_YEARMONTH, TO_YEARMONTH)`, which then calls
StatisticsManager's `getStatistics(FROM_YEARMONTH, TO_YEARMONTH)`. StatisticsManager will convert the YearMonth objects to
their respective indexes with the StatisticsManager's `getYearMonthIndex(YearMonth)` function.

StatisticsManager will then obtain the statistics for each of the queried months, and merge them together into a new
Statistics object. StatisticsManager will then return the Statistics back to the ModelManager, which would then return
it to the StatisticsCommand, which would then return the CommandResult with the statistics converted to a String to the
LogicManager.

==== Statistics and Record - Design considerations

1. The statistics are stored in months as the design only allows the doctor to query within a minimum timespan of 1 month.
Hence, it was decided that the statistics to be stored in months in a chronological order with an ArrayList for ease of
retrieval. +

2. Currently, as QuickDOcs is developed in 2019, and there are no plans to allow the doctor to add in past records,
the first index in the array of MonthStatistics is allocated to January 2019. Any MMYYYY value before 012019 will not be
allowed.

3. The MonthStatistics objects are stored in an ArrayList as it might be desirable for a MonthStatistics with the zero
statistics to exist (all variables 0 or no elements). Such a case might happen when the doctor goes on vacation for the
whole month. In addition, it would be easy to retrieve the MonthStatistics object of a specific MMYYYY by indexing.

==== Statistics and Record - Alternatives Considered
The following table lists out the alternatives designs considered for implementing the storage of the Records and Statistics.
[cols="1,2a,1, 1", options="header"]
|===
|Alternative |Description |Pros |Cons
// row 1
|*Storing of individual records for each month (Alternative chosen)*
|Individual records are stored within the MonthStatistics, along with the Statistics. When the Statistics for a
specific month is queried, update the latest statistics and return it.
|Individual records are kept, which could potentially be used for other calculations or features.
|Storing of individual records is extremely costly in terms of space
// row 2
|*Storing the merged statistics of all the records for each month*

|Only one Statistics object needs to be stored, which saves a lot of storage space.

=== Storing medicines in inventory

One essential aspect of clinic management is about managing medicine storage of the clinic. QuickDocs' medicine management module supports customized medicine organization via a browser-like directory format.

==== Current implementation

The current implementation takes a similar form as the Windows file browser. The user is free to determine for himself/herself how he/she wants the medicines to be arranged.

*Code:* {repoURL}/src/main/java/quickdocs/model/medicine/MedicineManager.java[MedicineManager.java]

To organize the inventory, the following methods in `MedicineManager` are used: +

* `addDirectory(new directory's name, path of parent directory)` -- Adds a new directory with the given name to the parent directory corresponding to the path.
* `addMedicine(name, quantity, path of parent directory, price)` -- Adds a new Medicine with given name, quantity and price to the parent directory corresponding to the path given.
* `addExistingMedicineToDirectory(medicine, path of parent directory)` -- Assuming the medicine already exists, add a reference of this medicine under the directory corresponding to the path.

[NOTE]
The current implementation does not allow multiple medicines with the same to exist simultaneously. However, one medicine could be placed in multiple directories.

[NOTE]
Both directories and medicines' names are case-insensitive.

From the initial empty state of the storage, the users could arrange their storage in these following ways:

1. The initial empty storage consists of an empty directory named as "root". The user can then add directories and medicines into the storage.

2. The `MedicineManager` keeps a list of sorted unique medicine in the inventory.

3. The user could add a new directory via `adddirec` command by specifying the path of the directory he/she wants to add into and the name of new directory.

4. The user could add new/existing medicine to a specific directory via the "addMed" command.

* 1. If there already exists a medicine with the same name in the storage, and the quantity and price is not specified in the command arguments, the existing medicine will be placed in the directory specified.

* 2. Otherwise, a new medicine with the specified name, quantity and price will be created and added to the specified directory.

{nbsp} +

Given below is an example of organizing medicine from an initial empty QuickDocs.

Step 1: Initially, the storage only consists of an empty directory called root. +

The list of unique medicine in `MedicineManager` is empty.

[[medicineModule_example1]]
image::medicineModule_example1.png[width='800']

{nbsp} +

Step 2: Via `adddirec root Internal`, a new directory called "Internal" is added under root. +

The list of unique medicine is still empty.

[[medicineModule_example2]]
image::medicineModule_example2.png[width='800']

{nbsp} +

Step 3: Via a few more `adddirec` commands, the figure below is an illustration of a sample inventory's framework. +

The list of unique medicine is still empty.

[[medicineModule_example3.png]]
image::medicineModule_example3.png[width='800']

{nbsp} +

Step 4: Now the user can add new medicines into the storage via `addmed root\Internal\General paracetamol p/40 q/50`. +

[[medicineModule_example4]]
image::medicineModule_example4.png[width='800']

The list of unique medicine is also updated.

[[listOfMedicine_example1]]
image::listOfMedicine_example1.png[width='800']

{nbsp} +

Step 5: Via a few more `addmed` commands, some more new medicines are added to the inventory. The following figure shows the result after that

[[medicineModule_example5]]
image::medicineModule_example5.png[width='800']

The list of unique medicine is also updated.

[[listOfMedicine_example2]]
image::listOfMedicine_example2.png[width='800']

{nbsp} +

Step 6: Now, the user found out that aspirin can also be used to treat high blood pressure and decides to put it under "Cardiology" as well. +

Via the `addmed root\Internal\Cardiology aspirin`, a reference to the existing aspirin medicine will be placed under the "Cardiology" directory. +

The figure below shows the result of this command.

[[medicineModule_example6]]
image::medicineModule_example6.png[width='800']

However, the list of unique medicine is not changed, as now new medicine is added.

[[listOfMedicine_example3]]
image:listOfMedicine_example2.png[width='800']

This six-step example illustrates the basic implementation of how medicines and directories are organized in QuickDocs.

- - -

When typing the directory path in the command box in the ui, QuickDocs supports intelligent suggestions about the next field. +

After the user entered at least one `\` character to indicate he is inputting a path, the suggestion mode will be turned on. +

The user could press Page Up / Page Down bottom to iterate to the previous or the next valid name of sub-directory or medicine in alphabetical order, given that the path given before the previous `\` character is valid.

Using the above sample inventory as an example: +

[[medicineModule_example7]]
image::medicineModule_example7.png[width='800']

* When the user types in `addmed root\`, the suggestion mode is turned on. +

* The user may not want to type in the full name of the directories, so when he types in `addmed root\in`, he could then press Page Down to iterate to the next valid name in alphabetical order, which is "Internal". +

* The command box is then automatically filled with `addmed root\Internal` +

* Similarly, if the user decides to traverse to the previous valid name, he could do so by press Page Up. And the command box will automatically be filled with `addmed root\External`. +

The figure below illustrates how this feature is implemented to make user's life more convenient. +

[[suggestion_diagram]]
.Sequence diagram illustrating the implementation of suggestion mode
image::suggestion_diagram.png[width='800]

- - -

QuickDocs also supports setting alarm level for medicines. Every time a medicine's storage falls below the designated level, a reminder is thrown. +

To convenient the users, QuickDocs allow not only threshold setting for individual medicines, but also threshold setting for directories. +

Taking the above sample inventory as an example: +

[[medicineModule_example8]]
image::medicineModule_example7.png[width='800']

Setting a threshold for a directory is effectively the same as setting the threshold for every medicine in the "subtree" of that directory. This is down by a tree-like traversal. +

For example, `alarm root\Internal 400` command sets the alarm level of all medicine in the subtree of "Internal" directory to 400. +

[[medicineModule_example8]]
image::medicineModule_example8.png[width='800]

==== Design consideration

1. The current implementation takes into consideration that the users may wish to have some freedom in determining the arrangement of medicine.

2. When prescribing medicines, a directory system that step by step leads to the desired medicine is to the convenience of the user.

3. By arranging the medicine by folders, it is then possible to support massive manipulation of medicine by directories.

4. Additionally, it is impossible to expect the doctor to always remember the full name of medicines correctly. There is a need for an easier way to identify medicines to operate on besides requiring the user to type in full names every time.

5. Considering that even a small private clinic may have a considerably large set of medicine available in their storage, massive operation on a large set of medicine should be made possible besides operations on single medicine.

==== Alternatives considered

The table illustrates some of the alternatives I considered during development of this medicine module, the relative advantages they have over the current implementation, and why they are not selected at the end.

[cols="1, 1, 2a, 2a", options="header"]
|===
|Alternative |Description |Comparative advantages |Reasons for not adopting
// row 1
|*Store medicines as a simple ArrayList*
|When users add a new medicine, just append a new medicine to the ArrayList. +

During operations on medicines, use name of medicine as a key to select the wanted medicine.

| * Simpler command format: The user could type in less arguments for the same commands.

* No maintainability issue: There is no constraint to the data structure, therefore there is no need to cross check all modules to ensure the constraints are maintained. Less likely to occur bugs.

| * The user must type in full name of medicines correctly to identify the correct medicine, This contradicts our belief that doctors are unlikely to know the full name of all his/her medicine.

* There is no freedom for the user to organize his/her medicine. When the user wants to view or operate on all medicine that share some common traits, he/she is not able to do so.

// row 2
|*Use a hash map to store the medicines*
| Use medicine name as the key and the medicine as the value. Search for the key to identify and operate on medicines.
| * Searching and identifying using names as key is more time-efficient compared to the current implementation, especially when data size is large. +

* Simpler command format, less fields to input per command.

| * There is no room for customized arrangement of medicine. +

* The user need to type in the correct full name of medicines to be able to identify medicines. This adds on extra difficulties for users to use the application.

* Does not support massive operations on similar medicines. Users need to repeat the same operations on many medicines.

//row 3
|*Store medicines in a list with tags*
| When adding medicines, require tags from the users so that searching and identifying medicine is easier.
| * Easier to list all medicines with the same tag. +

* Similar structure with patient module. Less efforts needed on both the developers' side and users' side to familiarise themselves with the data structure.
| * Potential lengthy commands if a medicine is widely applicable to many situations such that it may have a lot tags. +

* Have to either input the full name of medicine or recall the tag correctly to retrieve correct medicine. When there is a large set of medicines and tags, this alternatives provides little extra convenience as compared to the two alternatives above.

|===

Since QuickDocs aims to provide the most convenient experience given a large set of medicine in a clinic inventory, the medicine management module needs to provide a model that makes both typing commands, identifying the correct medicine and massive operation possible. +

Combined with the <<medicineModule_example7, suggestion mode>>, the current design is the best way to implement all of the three.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `quickdocs.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `quickdocs.model.PatientTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `LogicManagerTest`

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/quickdocs/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Adding patient records

. Add a new <<patient_records, patient record>>

.. Prerequisites: patient to be added must not have the same NRIC as an existing patient's NRIC, the
`listpat` command can be used to check if there are conflicting NRIC
.. Test case 1: `addpat n/Mohd Hamiru Bin Hamza r/S9876543C a/1 Tampines Street e/mhbh@gmail.com c/92344321 g/M d/1998-07-06` +
   Expected: Patient with name "Mohd Hamiru Bin Hamza" with NRIC S9876542C added
.. Test case 2: `add n/Nurul Huda Binte Hamza r/S9876543C a/3 Tampines Street e/nhbh@gmail.com c/93124432 g/F d/1998-11-02` +
   Expected: Patient will not be added, an error message will be shown to indicate that a patient with the same NRIC existed in the records
.. Other incorrect `addpat` commands to try: `addpat` with missing parameters such as gender and date of birth, `addpat` with name containing of symbols,
`addpat` with invalid NRIC values (8 numbers or invalid last letters).

=== Editing patient records

. Edit the fields of an existing patient record

.. Prerequisites: use the `listpat` command to check for existing patients to be edited, or simply add one using `addpat`
if there isn't any. You need at least 2 patients to perform this manual test.
.. Test case1: `editPat EXISTING_NRIC n/Peter Tan g/M d/1990-09-01` +
   Expected: selected patient will have his or her name changed to "Peter Tan", gender changed to "M" and date of birth changed
   to 1990-09-01.
.. Test case2: `editPat EXISTING_NRIC n/Perry Tan r/ANOTHER_EXISTING_NRIC` +
   Expected: An error message will be shown to indicate that the edit to the current patient will cause it to have a conflicting NRIC
   with another patient's NRIC

   Expected: A message to indicate the start of the consultation session will be shown at the main display. A label will be displayed
   at the bottom right, displaying the message along with the patient's NRIC as well.
.. Test case 2: After test case 1, enter `consult r/ANOTHER_EXISTING_NRIC` +
   Expected: An error message will be shown to alert you that there is already an ongoing consultation session.
.. Test case 3: exit QuickDocs, and then enter `consult r/NON_EXISTING_NRIC` +
   Expected: since there are no patients with the NRIC, an error message will be shown to indicate that the consultation session cannot start
   for a non-existing patient

=== Ending a consultation

. End a consultation session after providing the prescription and diagnosis. A consultation session can only end after
  both the diagnosis and prescription have been recorded.

   together with the appointment details. A reminder for this appointment will also be created and you can see it in the reminder
   sidebar on the right, if the date of the appointment is in the current week.
.. Test case 2: After test case 1, enter `addapp r/EXISTING_NRIC d/2019-10-23 s/16:30 e/17:30 c/Weekly checkup` +
   Expected: since this new appointment a clash in timing with the appointment added in test case 1, an error message will be shown

=== Adding a new directory for medicine storage

[NOTE]
The following tests assume the tester starts with an empty storage.

. Add a new directory under the root directory

.. Test case 1: `adddirec root NEW_DIRECTORY` +
   Expected: A success message confirming the successful addition will be shown in the main display. A new directory called 'NEW_DIRECTORY' will be added to root directory, which is verifiable via `listmed root` command.
.. Test case 2:`adddirec root NEW DIRECTORY` +
   Expected: As the new directory's name includes a white space which is not allowed, no new directory will be added and an error message will show up.
.. Test case 3:`adddirec root\Internal NEW_DIRECTORY` +
   Expected: As the tester starts with an empty storage, there is no existing directory at root\Internal. No new directory will be added, and an error message will show up saying "No directory is found at the given path."
.. Other incorrect `adddirec` commands to try: commands with missing new directory name

=== Adding a medicine into a directory

[NOTE]
The following tests assume that `root\Internal\General` is a valid path, i,e there is already a directory 'General' under directory 'Internal' under root directory.

. Add a new medicine into storage

.. Test case 3: `addmed root\Internal\General paracetamol p/2.4 q/34.5` +
   Expected: The addition will fail. As the quantity in QuickDocs are in terms of units, no fractional number is allowed in the quantity field. An error message will show up.
.. Other incorrect `addmed` commands to try: missing any prefixes, invalid path
. Add an existing medicine into a different directory
.. Prerequisites: There is already an existing medicine called 'paracetamol' somewhere in the storage.
.. Test case 1: `addmed root\Internal\General paracetamol` +
   Expected: A new reference to the same medicine will be added to root\Internal\General. A success message will show in the main display.
