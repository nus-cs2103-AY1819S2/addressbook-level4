I am Jeremy Loye, a Year 2 Computer Science student currently taking _CS2103T_.
This page is written to detail my contributions to the project _In-Credit-Ble_
undertaken in the module. I will be giving a brief introduction about the project,
 followed by describing my contributions to the project. Finally, I will be presenting
 the sections of the User and Developer Guide that I have documented. +

== PROJECT: In-Credit-Ble (Finance Tracker)

---

== Overview

_In-Credit-Ble_ is a desktop Finance Tracker that helps user to keep track of their
 finances and set budgets for themselves. We tailored it to users who wanted to manage
 their finance in a efficient and effective manner without any frills. It is made
 to cater for users who prefer typing over using the mouse since the App operates with
 a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

_In-Credit-Ble_ was developed by a team consisting of me and four other students from the
 National University of Singapore as part of a Software Engineering module (CS2103T).
 Through the module, we adapted an existing Java codebase to develop our very own functional
 product, _In-Credit-Ble_, within the span of 13 weeks while learning basic software engineering
 concepts. In the subsequent sections, I will be documenting my contributions to this project
 through the major and minor features implemented for _In-Credit-Ble_.

== Summary of Contributions
|===
|The Summary of Contributions will detail my meaningful contributions to the Project. Within this first section,
I will detail the features that I have implemented as well as other project-related contributions in the way of
_Project Management_ and _Community_.

=== Contributed Features

==== *Major enhancement*: Implementing a `Budget` feature
* *_What it does_*: The feature lets the user set a budget for the App to give themselves a target of how
much to spend. Through the feature, the user can monitor their current expenditure based on the expense records
they keyed in and check how close it is to reaching the budget they set in the Budget Panel of the User Interface.
* *_Justification_*: The feature is part of the core of the App that my team was aiming at. It is essential in
helping users to keep track of their overall expenditure and giving them a visible budget goal to work towards.
Furthermore, the `Budget` feature forms the basis for the implementation of add-on budget features like the
`CategoryBudget`.
* Highlights of feature:
** The budget of the Finance Tracker can be set rather easily with the `set` function and can be changed multiple
times. Implementation of the feature is comprehensive, covering four major components of the Application. The commands
are implemented in the `Logic` component along with the logic behind the execution of command and the `Budget` class itself
is implemented in the `Model` component. The `Storage` part of the App saves changes to budget data in terms of
current spending and budget set while the `UI` displays the budget to the user.
** The current expenditure and budget is easily viewed in the Budget Panel of the App with a simple budget bar to show
how much of the budget a user has currently spent. The data for current expenditure and budget is updated immediately
each time a user sets a budget or keys in an expenditure.

==== *Minor enhancements*:
* Changing data files for different users through `setfile`
** _What it does_:
The feature lets a user change the file that is used to read and store expense and budget data.
Essentially, it allows a user to maintain multiple expenditure and budget profiles or for multiple users to use
the same Finance Tracker without overwriting of each others' records.
** _Justification_:
It is limiting to just have one user profile when there could be multiple users of the
same FinanceTracker app as multiple users cannot be tracked. A single user could want to maintain multiple
FinanceTracker profiles for different purposes such as personal and business. Furthermore, since only one budget
can be set per instance of the FinanceTracker App, different files can be used to keep track of budgets and
 expenses for different months.
** Highlights of feature:
*** This feature is called by the `setfile` command. The command will load the file designated by the filename.
If the file was not previously created, a default data set will be created.

* Adding *undo/redo* support for commands that make changes to the FinanceTracker.
** I have improved on the undo and redo commands provided by the original addressbook to support undo-ing and
redo-ing of all the new commands added in the development of _In-Credit-Ble_ that modify the FinanceTracker.
** List of commands supported: `set`, `allocate`, `spend`, `edit`, `delete`, `sort`, `reverse`, `setfile`,
`clear`, `description`

* Improvement of `Storage` logic to store budget data
** I added several classes to enable the Finance Tracker to store budget data in its data files. This ties
in and supports both the `Budget` feature and `setfile` feature since it ensures that when the Finance Tracker
is reloaded or the data file is changed, the user budget data remains and is loaded correctly.

== Contributions to the User Guide
|===
| In this section, I will be displaying what I have written for the User Guide. The User Guide is an important
document that assists new users in getting acquitted with our application so that they can operate it. It is
important to make the User Guide reader-friendly to the less tech-savvy. Thus, I hope that I can demonstrate
those skills in what I have written for the User Guide.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
|===
| This final section will include the sections of my contribution to the Developer Guide.
The Developer Guide is a document used to specify the design and implementation of our project for new developers
to understand our codebase. Through my contributions to the Developer Guide, I hope to illustrate my capacity
to write technical documentation that is comprehensive and easy to understand for new developers.
