== Introduction

{bl}
[blue]#Welcome to the _In-Credit-Ble_ User Guide!# _In-Credit-Ble_ is a desktop application designed to help university
students who have difficulty managing their finances due to their many daily transactions. It is also important for these
students to manage their finances due to their inflexibility to spend frivolously as they lack a formal income.

_In-Credit-Ble_ provides you with features such as having a budget bar to show how much you have spent compared to a budget
that you have previously set, and showing of a summary of your transactions in a pie chart. Our user-friendly interface
will make it easier for you to see how much you can safely spend within your budget and be more aware of your spending habits.
If you are an individual who prefers to type using a Command Line Interface(CLI), then _In-Credit-Ble_ is the application for you!

This user guide shows you how to get started using _In-Credit-Ble_. It also provides in-depth documentation on the
different features and shows you how to perform basic _In-Credit-Ble_ operations.

[[Features]]
== Features
{bl}
[blue]#This section describes the various features _In-Credit-Ble_ has to offer.# Examples are also included to give you
step-by-step instructions on how to use the different commands.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*[navy]#Command Format#*

* Words in `[fuchsia]#UPPER_CASE#` are the parameters to be supplied by the user [navy]#e.g.# in `[fuchsia]#set $/AMOUNT#`,
`[fuchsia]#AMOUNT#` is a parameter which can be used as `[fuchsia]#set $/200.00#`.
* Items in square brackets are optional [navy]#e.g# `[fuchsia]#search FLAG KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]#` can be used as `[fuchsia]#search -cat clothes#` or as
`[fuchsia]#search -name cake lunch#`.
* Items with `[fuchsia]#…#`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
* If you provide more than the number of specified parameters
([navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#set $/500 $/400#` or `[fuchsia]#spend n/Chicken n/Duck $/10 $/20 c/Food c/Lunch#`), the latest parameter is taken
([navy]#e.g.# Budget is set to $400, Record added is Name: Duck, Amount: $20, Category: Lunch).
====
{bl}

<<<
=== Budget Management
{bl}

// tag::set[]
==== Setting a budget: `[fuchsia]#set#`
[navy]#You can use this command to set a budget for the current instance of _In-Credit-Ble_ Finance Tracker.# +

*Format*: `[fuchsia]#set $/AMOUNT#`

****
*[navy]#Examples#*:

* `[fuchsia]#set $/500#`
* `[fuchsia]#set $/500.50#`
****
[NOTE]
====
* The budget set must contain a valid amount. A valid amount is a positive number with
0 or 2 decimal places. Amount entered cannot be larger than 100,000,000.
* If you provide multiple amounts ([navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#set $/30 $/50#`), only the last amount you provided will
be used to set the budget (`[fuchsia]#$/50#` in the example). Only the last amount needs to be a valid
amount ([navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#set $/1a $/10#` works while `[fuchsia]#set $/10 $/1a#` does not).
* If a budget was previously set, the old budget will be overwritten by the new budget specified
by the `[fuchsia]#set#` command.
* The budget you set and current spending will be displayed in the https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#budget-panel[Budget Panel].
* You can only work with one budget for each instance of Finance Tracker. You are able
 to adjust this budget using the `[fuchsia]#set#` command again by indicating a different amount.
* If you want to have a new budget for a different month, you can use the `[fuchsia]#setfile#` command
detailed in https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#changing-financetracker-data-storage-location-setfile[Changing FinanceTracker data storage location: `setfile`].
* The rationale is to keep the
UI as clean as possible without extra panels for past budgets.
* You can use `[fuchsia]#allocate#` to set various category sub-budgets for categories.

====

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Take note that you can spend over the budget set and set a budget lower than current spending. The
rationale is for you to be able to see how much you have exceeded your budget set to better plan your
expenditure in the future since the application is unable to stop you from spending.
* The budget you set must be higher than or equal to the sum of the budgets allocated to individual
category. The rationale is that it would be pointless to set an overall budget if individual category
budgets are going to exceed it.
====
// end::set[]
{bl}

// tag::allocate[]
==== Allocating budget based on categories: `[fuchsia]#allocate#`

[navy]#You can use this command to set a budget for a category in _In-Credit-Ble_ Finance Tracker.# +

*Alias*: `[fuchsia]#allo#`

*Format*: `[fuchsia]#allocate $/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY#`
****
*[navy]#Examples#*:

* `[fuchsia]#allocate $/50 c/Dining#`
* `[fuchsia]#allocate $/100 c/CloThEs#`
* `[fuchsia]#allocate $/100.10 c/FOOD#`
* `[fuchsia]#allo $/123.10 c/GiRLfrIEND#`
****
[NOTE]
====
* Amount entered cannot be larger than 100,000,000.
* Category name can only be one word (no spaces allowed).
* If you provide multiple categories ([navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#allocate $/50.00 c/Food c/Clothes#`),
only the last category you provided will be taken (in the previous e.g., the command will
set budget for `[fuchsia]#Clothes#` category. Your last category must be of the correct format (see below).
* Category names are case-insensitive. ([navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#CLotHes#`, `[fuchsia]#clothes#` and `[fuchsia]#CLOTHES#` refer to `[fuchsia]#Clothes#`).
* If a budget was previously set for the category, the old category budget will be replaced
by the new `[fuchsia]#allocate#` command.
* The category budget that you allocate should be more than current spending in that category as it would not make
sense to set a budget that is below the amount that you have already spent on that category.
+
For example, if you have spent $50.50 on the cateogry `[fuchsia]#Food#`, you will receive an error message when you try to
`[fuchsia]#allocate#` $40.00 to the category `[fuchsia]#Food#`.
* Category name supplied must be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric[alphanumeric]
and cannot contain special characters such as `*:<>;\/|?~^%$@#*`.
* For you to see the category budgets and the current spending in each of the allocated category budget, use the `[fuchsia]#show#`
command shown in the next section.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can still spend over the category budget set. The rationale is for you to be able to see
how much you have exceeded your budget allocated in that category so that you will be able to better plan your
expenditure in the future. +
(For e.g. if you allocated $50.00 to `Clothes` and have yet to spend anything in the
category, you can still spend more than $50.00 after setting the category budget.) +

However, if you have already spent an amount in the category, but have yet to set a budget for the category, it would
not make sense for you to set a budget smaller than the current spending in the category. Thus an error message will be
shown in Result Display if you attempt to do so.
====
// end::allocate[]
{bl}

<<<
// tag::show[]
==== Showing allocated budget and spending in categories: `[fuchsia]#show#`

[navy]#You can use this command to see your current spending and the category budget allocated in
_In-Credit-Ble_ Finance Tracker.# +

*Alias*: `[fuchsia]#showCatBudget#`

*Format*: `[fuchsia]#show#`, `[fuchsia]#showCatBudget#`

****
*[navy]#Example#*:

* The following example will show you an example of what will be listed given the following budget allocation
and expenditure in the following categories:
** `[fuchsia]#set $/500#`
** `[fuchsia]#allocate $/100 c/CloThEs#`
** `[fuchsia]#allocate $/100.10 c/FOOD#`
** `[fuchsia]#allo $/123.10 c/GiRLfrIEND#`
** `[fuchsia]#spend n/Buffet $/50.00 c/Food#`
** `[fuchsia]#spend n/Versace Jacket $/95.00 c/Clothes#`
** `[fuchsia]#spend n/Girlfriend gift $/99.99 c/Girlfriend#`
** `[fuchsia]#show#`
* The following will be displayed on the *Result Display* +
_(See Graphical User Interface Introduction (GUI) if you are
unsure of the elements of the GUI):_

.Example of `[fuchsia]#show#` command
image::show_example.png[width ="300"]

[NOTE]
====
* The category budgets will be shown with the latest allocated category budget in the Result Display.
* If there are no category budgets allocated yet, the result display will display a message
to let you know.

=== Expense Entry Management

{bl}

// tag::spend[]
==== Adding an expense: `[fuchsia]#spend#`

[navy]#You can keep track of how much you have spent by adding an expense entry to _In-Credit-Ble_.#

*Alias*: `[fuchsia]#add#`

*Format*: `[fuchsia]#spend n/NAME $/AMOUNT [d/DATE] c/CATEGORY [r/DESCRIPTION]#`

****
*[navy]#Examples#*:

* `[fuchsia]#spend n/cake $/5.50 d/15/03/2019 c/Food r/Birthday celebration#`
* `[fuchsia]#spend n/movie $/10 d/16/03/2019 c/Entertainment r/Avengers: End Game#`
****

[NOTE]
====
* If you provide multiple categories ([navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#spend n/Tshirt $/10.00 d/31/03/2019 c/Food c/Clothes#`),
only the last category you provided will be taken (In the previous e.g, the command will
add expense for `[fuchsia]#Clothes#` category).
* Category names are case-insensitive. ([navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#CLotHes#`, `[fuchsia]#clothes#` and `[fuchsia]#CLOTHES#` refer to the same
category and will be shown with the first character in uppercase and the rest of the characters
in lowercase. In the above example, it will be shown as `[fuchsia]#Clothes#`.)
* Category name supplied must be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric[alphanumeric]
and cannot contain special characters such as `*:<>;\/|?~^%$#@*`.
* Date cannot be a date in the future. Addition of future expenses are not allowed.
* If no date is inputted, current local date will be used instead.
* Name, category and description inputs are limited to 40 characters each.
* Amount entered cannot be larger than 100,000,000.
* Order of the different parameters does not matter.

You can also specify a report period by stating the number of days or months via the `[fuchsia]#PERIOD_AMOUNT#` and `[fuchsia]#PERIOD#` parameters.
`[fuchsia]#PERIOD_AMOUNT#` refers to a positive integer, whereas `[fuchsia]#PERIOD#` refers to a "day" or "month", represented as "d" and "m" respectively.
However, these parameters are optional.

To exit the summary view mode, simply type `[fuchsia]#summary#` in the command box again.
Your screen should change back to the browser view mode as shown in the diagram below.

[NOTE]
====
* If a period is not specified, then the summary will show a default report period of the last 7 days.
* Deleted entries are not included in the summary.
* Adding more entries while in the summary view mode will update the pie chart statistics automatically, as long as the expense falls within the specified report period
* For best viewing experience, add up to 8 categories. Beyond that, not all labels may appear on the pie chart due to space constraints. However, the legend will still display the expenditure for all categories added.

==== Changing FinanceTracker data storage location: `[fuchsia]#setfile#`
[navy]#You can change the file used to store the data of the application.# Essentially,
you can maintain multiple sets of expenditure and budget data for different users
or profiles. +

In addition, one user can also have multiple files for a recurring period (weeks, months etc.)
for the user to manage their budget based on a time period of his/ her liking.

*Format*: `[fuchsia]#setfile f/FILENAME#`

****
*[navy]#Examples#*:

* `[fuchsia]#setfile f/Daily Expenses#`
* `[fuchsia]#setfile f/JohnDoe#`
* `[fuchsia]#setfile f/Personal Finances.April.2019#`
* `[fuchsia]#setfile f/Company June Petty Cash Finances#`
****

[NOTE]
====
* The filename should not contain any file paths ([navy]#e.g.# /data/file) or extensions
([navy]#e.g.# file.json). The filename must also be 250 characters or lesser and should not
contain any special characters or be left blank.
* If multiple filenames are provided ([navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#setfile f/file1 f/file2#`) only the last
filename provided will be taken in as the filename (`[fuchsia]#file2#` in this example).
Only the last filename needs to be a valid filename
([navy]#e.g.# `[fuchsia]#setfile f/$file f/file#` works while `[fuchsia]#set f/file f/$file#` does not).
* If the file specified by the filename is the same as the current file, nothing will happen as the same file
will be loaded. Refer to Figuere 22 if you are unsure of what your current file is.
* If the file specified by the filename does not already exist or is corrupted, a new blank file
will be created with no data in the Finance Tracker. Otherwise, the data stored
in the file will be loaded into the Finance Tracker. The example below illustrates this.

.Example of what happens when a existing file is loaded and when a new file is created.

=== Upcoming Features

{bl}

==== Login Feature `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`
_In-Credit-Ble_ will implement a login feature so that your data and personal finance records will remain safe and secure.
Your personal data will be encrypted and stored in your own account that can be secured with a password.

With this feature, multiple users will be able to use _In-Credit-Ble_ on the same computer without being able to access or modify each other's data.

{bl}

==== Enhancements to Summary Feature `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`
Instead of the current pie chart, _In-Credit-Ble_'s summary feature will display an overview of your expenditures as an
Aster Plot chart instead, as shown in the diagram below.

.Example of Aster Plot Graph
image::asterPlot.png[width="200"]

This will make it more effective in showing the user what is the remaining budget amount for each category.
It also allows users to easily perceive whether their spending is within their budget for each category.

// end::upcomingFeatures[]

==== Enhancements to UI to allow `[fuchsia]#CategoryBudgets#` to be shown `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`
Instead of using the `show` command to list the category budgets in the Result Display, _In-Credit-Ble_'s
`allocate` command will immediately display the category budgets allocated on another Panel known as *CategoryBudget
Panel* in v2.0 of _In-Credit-Ble_.

We will have separate budget bars (similar to the one in Figure 6) within this panel for each category which will fill
up as the user enters more entries for the corresponding category.


{bl}

==== Separate expenditures based on methods of payment (Cash, Visa, DBS PayLah) `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`

_In-Credit-Ble_ will collaborate with secure methods of payment to allow tracking of your cashless transactions.
These include, but not limited to, payment services such as DBS PayLah, Visa/MasterCard, Amex and Paypal.

By paying through these third-party applications, your transactions will automatically be updated
and recorded as entries in _In-Credit-Ble_.

{bl}

// tag::savingpatterns[]
==== Establish saving patterns based on record and derive projected savings/expenses in a time span `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`

Your monthly finance records will be archived at the end of the month. This information will be used to derive
the projected savings and expenses of future months, based on analysing your spending patterns.
// end::savingpatterns[]

{bl}

==== Links to financial articles `[yellow]#[coming in v2.0]#`

You will be able to list categories of financial articles that you are interested in
([navy]#e.g.# investment, stock market, taxes). Based on these categories, _In-Credit-Ble_ will use Google API to search for
related articles for you to view.

== FAQ

{bl}

*Q*: [navy]#How do I transfer my data to another Computer?#

*A*: You can install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file
that contains the data of your previous _In-Credit-Ble_ folder.

*Q*: [navy]#Will the application support different currency?#

*A*: At the current version, the application is unable to support transactions record in different currency.
You will need to calculate and enter your input based on your local currency.

_In-Credit-Ble_  aims to support multi-currency transactions in `[yellow]#v2.0#`.
