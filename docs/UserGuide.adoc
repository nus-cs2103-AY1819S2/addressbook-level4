== Introduction

_Acquizition_ is a *desktop app* for easy language acquisition
and memory retention. By analyzing your performance on recalling
the flashcards, _Acquizition_ cleverly determines which flashcards
should be tested to maximize recollection.

Additionally, _Acquizition_ provides you with a user-friendly
Graphical User Interface (GUI) to view your flashcards. If you can
type quickly, you'll also enjoy the Command-Line Interface (CLI)
that's streamlined for users like you.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the _Acquizition_
installation process, command format and Frequently
Asked Questions (FAQs). Jump to <<Quick Start>>
to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your computer.
.  Download the latest `acquizition.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your
cards collection.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try the following to get your feet wet!

* `add f/Kamusta b/Hello t/Tagalog` : Creates a flashcard with _Kamusta_ on the
front and _Hello_ on the back, with the tag _Tagalog_.
* `add f/Terima kasih b/Thank you t/BahasaIndonesia` : Creates a flashcard with
_Terima kasih_ on the front and _Thank you_ on the back, with the tag _Bahasa
Indonesia_.
* `find b/Thank you` : lists all flashcards whose back face shows _Thank you_.
* `delete 2` : deletes the second card in the collection.
* `exit` : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> and <<FeaturesQuiz>> for the detailed descriptions of
each command.

[[Features]]
== Features (Collection)

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` should be substituted by you!
    ** Example: In `add f/FRONT_TEXT b/BACK TEXT`, `FRONT_TEXT` and `BACK_TEXT`
    should be replaced to, say, `add f/Kamusta b/Hello`.
* Words in `[square brackets]` are optional.
    ** Example: In `add f/FRONT_TEXT b/BACK_TEXT [i/IMAGE_PATH]`, `IMAGE_PATH`
    is optional. You can replace it with, say, `add f/Babae b/Woman i/images/woman.png`.
* Words with `...` after them can be specified multiple times.
    ** Example: In `add f/FRONT_TEXT b/BACK_TEXT [t/TAG]...`, `TAG` is optional
    and you can specify multiple tags. You can replace it with, say, `add f/Lalaki b/Man
    t/Tagalog t/Noun`.
* You can specify the parameters in any order; if the command specifies `f/FRONT_TEXT
b/BACK_TEXT`, you can also type them in the order `b/BACK_TEXT f/FRONT_TEXT`.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Shows this document!

Format: `help`.

=== Adding a flashcard: `add`

Adds a new flashcard to the collection.

Format: `​add f/[FRONT_TEXT] b/[BACK_TEXT] [i/IMAGE_PATH] [t/TAG]​...​`

****
* A flashcard can optionally have a single image attached to it. You should specify this
image through the use of the `IMAGE_PATH`, which is a relative path provided by the `image` command.
Note that you must first import the image through the `image` command. See <<ImportImage>> for more details.
* A flashcard can have any number of tags (including zero).
** We highly recommend using tags if you intend to study multiple subjects. This allows
you to filter by tag later on, so you can study only the flashcards having a certain tag.
** Tags must be alphanumeric; in particular, they cannot contain spaces. For example,
`t/Bahasa Indonesia` is forbidden; use `t/BahasaIndonesia` instead.
****

Examples:

* `add f/Kamusta b/Hello t/Tagalog`
* `add f/さようなら b/Goodbye i/images/goodbye.jpg t/Japanese t/Greetings`

=== Listing all flashcards : `list`

Shows a list of all flashcards in the card collection.

Format: `list`

=== Editing a flashcard : `edit`

Edits a flashcard already in the collection. +

Format: ​`edit INDEX [f/FRONT_TEXT] [b/BACK_TEXT] [i/IMAGE_PATH] [t/TAG]...​`

****
* Edits the flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index
number shown in the list of all flashcards (1, 2, 3, ...).
* You can leave `IMAGE_PATH` empty to remove the image associated with a
flashcard. That is, to remove an image, specify `i/`.
* When specifying a `TAG`, _all existing tags_ will be removed. If you want to
add a new tag, you must restate all the previous tags and add the new one.
** Note that the tags will not be affected if you do not specify any `TAG`.
** Likewise, you can remove all the tags associated with a card by specifying
`t/` with nothing afterwards.
****

Examples:

* `edit 2 f/Halo` +
The second flashcard will be edited and the front face will be updated to _Halo_.
* `edit 3 i/ t/` +
The third flashcard will have its image and all its tags removed, if it had any.

=== Deleting a flashcard : `delete`

Deletes a flashcard already in the collection. +

Format: ​`delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the flashcard at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index
number shown in the list of all flashcards (1, 2, 3, ...).
****

Example:

* `delete 2` +
The second flashcard will be deleted.

// tag::find[]
=== Finding flashcards by keyword(s): `find`

Finds and lists all the flashcards whose front text, back text or collection tags
contain _any_ of the given keywords. You can also specify a success rate range which
will filter the flashcards to have a success rate within the given range.

Format: ​`find [f/FRONT_FACE]... [b/BACK_FACE]... [t/TAG]... [s/SUCCESS_RATE_RANGE]`

****
* You must specify at least _one_ keyword.
* Multiple keywords can be specified for the front text, back text and tags by
specifying multiple prefixes. For example, `find f/Kamusta f/Terima kasih` finds
and lists _all_ the flashcards whose front face contains the word _Kamusta_ or _Terima_ or _kasih_.
** Multiple collection tags must be specified with multiple prefixes. `t/Tagalog Japanese` is invalid;
use `t/Tagalog t/Japanese` instead.
* Keywords are not case sensitive: `f/Kamusta` will match `kamusta`, `kAmUsTa` or `KAMUSTA`.
* Specifying a success rate range will filter the flashcards to be listed to be within
the specified range (inclusive) and is in the form of [s/LOWEBOUND UPPERBOUND] separated by a single space character.
** Specifying a success rate range on its own with no other prefixes will display _all_ flashcards
having a success rate within that range.
* All prefixes must be followed by a keyword or value and cannot be left blank.
****

image::Ui-find.png[width="790"]

Examples:

* `find t/Chinese t/Japanese` +
This will find and list all the flashcards that have the _Chinese_ or _Japanese_ tag.
* `find f/Hello b/Hello` +

equal to 50%.
* `find s/25 100` +
This will find and list all the flashcards that have a success rate more than or equal to 25%
and less than or equal to 100%.
// end::find[]

=== Selecting a flashcard : `select`

Selects the flashcard identified by the index number used in the displayed flashcard list.

Format: `select INDEX`

****
* Selects a flashcard and displays it on the flashcard view on the right pane.
* The success rate of the selected flashcard will be shown on the command result box.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index must be a positive integer `1, 2, 3, …`
* Alternatively, you can select a card by clicking it on the flashcard list panel.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the second flashcard in the list.
* `find t/chinese` +
`select 1` +
Selects the first flashcard in the filtered list with chinese tag.

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order.

Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the card collection to the state before the previous undoable command was executed.

Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the card collection's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `good`, `bad`, and `import`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
Reverses the `delete 1` command.
* `select 1` +
`list` +
`quiz` +
`exit` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.
* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` +
`undo` +
Reverses the `clear` command, then reverses the `delete 1` command.

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command.

Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +

[[ImportImage]]
=== Importing an image : `image`
Adds an image into _Acquizition_'s internal directory.

Format: `image FILE_PATH`

****
* This imports an image into _Acquizition_'s internal directory. The image imported must not
have the same name as an image already in the internal directory.
* `FILE_PATH` must be an _absolute path_ to the image.
* This command will also report the path you must reference your image when adding or
editing your image through the `add` or `edit` commands.
****

Example:

* `image C:\Users\Robin\Desktop\girlfriend.png` +
This will import the image `girlfriend.png` into _Acquizition_'s internal directory, and give
you the path you must use to reference this image through the `add` or `edit` commands.

=== Showing aggregate statistics : `stats`

Shows aggregate statistics for all the flashcards with any of the given tags. +
If no tag is specified, it shows aggregate statistics for all cards currently in the list.

Format: `stats [t/TAG]...`

****
* You can use `find` followed by `stats` to show aggregate statistics for all the cards found
and listed by the find command.
****

Examples:

* `stats t/Chinese t/Japanese` +
This will show aggregate statistics for all flashcards that have the _Chinese_ or _Japanese_ tag.
* `find f/Kamusta` +
`stats` +
This will find and list all flashcards with _Kamusta_ in their front face then show aggregate
statistics for all those flashcards.

// tag::share[]
=== Exporting flashcards to a text file : `share`
Creates a text file _flashcards.txt_ containing all the flashcards currently being listed.

Format: `share DIRECTORY_PATH`

****
* The text file created by the share command will be saved in the specified directory; you can then share
 this text file with your friends.
* Once your friends have a copy of the text file, they can import the flashcards using the `import` command.
* **Images are not shared.**
* Calling the share command multiple times on the same directory will overwrite the previous version of the file.
****

Examples:

* `find t\Chinese` +
`share C:\Users\Alice\Desktop` +
This will create a text file called _flashcards.txt_ at the specified location containing all the flashcards that
have the _Chinese_ tag.
** (Note that DIRECTORY_PATH is user specific)

* In the illustrated example below, one of the cards in the text file already existed locally. So only 6 out of
the 7 flashcards in the file successfully imported.

image::Ui-preImport.png[width="790"]
image::Ui-postImport.png[width="790"]
// end::share[]


// tag::import[]
=== Importing flashcards from a text file : `import`
Adds flashcards from a text file to your existing collection.

Format: `import FILE_PATH`

****
* This imports all the cards from a text file (produced by the `share` command) to your collection.
** This does not replace your existing card collection; it simply adds new cards from the text file.
** This command will also report the number of cards successfully imported.
** Unsuccessfully imported cards may have already existed locally or may be corrupted.
****

Example:

* `import C:\Users\Alice\Desktop\flashcards.txt` +
This will import the cards from _flashcards.txt_ to your collection.
// end::import[]



=== Deleting all flashcards : `clear`

Deletes all flashcards.

Format: `clear`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`
Exits the program if you are not in quiz mode. +
If you are in quiz mode, this exits quiz mode instead. See <<QuizExit>> for more details.

Format: `exit`

// tag::quiz[]
[[FeaturesQuiz]]
== Features (Quiz)

=== Entering quiz mode : `quiz`

image::Ui-quiz.png[width="790"]

Enters quiz mode. +
A card will be shown to you one by one randomly with distribution based on accuracy of each flashcard. +
You can then self-verify whether you accurately recall the back side of the flashcard.

Format: `quiz`

****
* Enters quiz mode with the cards on the filtered flashcard list panel.
* This will start a quiz session. The flashcard list panel on the left will change to a quiz panel.
* The quiz panel contains the number of cards remaining on the quiz, as well as the number of good and bad feedback received.
* The card view panel on the right will display the quizzed cards one by one, with the back face of the flashcard hidden.
****

=== Showing back face of flashcard : `show`

Shows the back face of the flashcard being quizzed.

Format: `show`

****
* If the back face of the flashcard is already shown, this command will do nothing.
* Note that you can only use this command inside quiz mode.
****

=== Giving feedback : `good` or `bad`

Gives user feedback on quiz mode.

Format: `good` or `bad`

****
* In order to give feedback of how well you do in the quiz mode, you can type in either `good` or `bad` for each card in the quiz.
* After you type `good` or `bad`, Acquizition will record the feedback on the card shown, as well as incrementing the number of good and bad feedback.
* Acquizition will then proceed to show the next flashcard to be quizzed. If there are no cards left, it will exit quiz mode.
* This command is usually, but not necessarily, used after the `show` command. That is, after you look at the back face of the flashcard, you can dictate how well you recall the back face of the flashcard.
* Note that you can only use this command inside quiz mode.
****

Examples:

* `quiz` +
`good` +
This will increment the number of good feedback of the card shown, thus, the success rate of this card will increase. +
Then, the next card in the quiz queue will be shown.
* `quiz` +
`show` +
`bad` +
This will increment the number of bad feedback of the card shown, thus, the success rate of this card will decrease. +
Then, the next card in the quiz queue will be shown.
* `quiz` +
`good` +
`...` +
`good` +
Suppose this is the last card to show inside quiz mode. Acquizition will record the statistics of the quiz mode and exit the quiz mode.

=== Smart command : kbd:[Enter]

It can be troublesome to always have to type `show` and `good`. +
You can use a _smart command_ that cleverly chooses the appropriate command to run.

Format: kbd:[Enter]

****
* To initiate a smart command, you just need to press enter.
* If you are in quiz mode, and the back face of the quizzed card is not yet shown, smart command will execute a `show` command.
* If you are in quiz mode, and the back face of the quizzed card has been shown, smart command will execute a `good` command.
* This dramatically reduces your time to navigate through the quiz!
****

Examples:

* `quiz` +
kbd:[Enter] +
kbd:[Enter] +
This will first show the back face of the card, then will mark the card as good.
* `quiz` +
kbd:[Enter] +
`bad` +
This will show the back face of the card, then will mark the card as bad.
* `quiz` +
kbd:[Enter] +
`...` +
kbd:[Enter] +
This will go through all the cards in the quiz mode and mark them all as good.

[[QuizExit]]
=== Exiting quiz mode : `exit`
Exits quiz mode prematurely if you are in quiz mode. +

Format: `exit`
// end::quiz[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I save my data? +
*A*: Your data is saved automatically after each command; there is no need to
explicitly save.

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file
it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Aqquizition
folder.
