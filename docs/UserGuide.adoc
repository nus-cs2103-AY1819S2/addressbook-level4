== Introduction

*The Real App* is an enhanced address book designed primarily for *real estate agents* who need to store large amount of customer contacts as well as property information. More importantly, this product is optimized for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts, and *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, this product can help you manage all your contact and property information quickly and securely. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
