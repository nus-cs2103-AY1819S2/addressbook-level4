Format: `sort [or/ORDER] [l/LIMIT]`

[NOTE]
====
* `ORDER` refers to the order in which the restaurants will be sorted and can only take the form of `or/ASC` or `or/DES`, case-insensitive.

Restaurants with no reviews will have no ratings, and will thus have an `N.A.` rating. Restaurants with `N.A.` rating will come before
those with positive ratings if in ascending order, and after those with positive ratings if sorted in descending order.
====

Example of usage:

- Before the `sort` command is executed, the following shows the list of restaurants in the restaurant list.

image::setcategories-stepone.png[]
_Figure 1: After typing `list`. Oh no, the categories for Aston's are wrong! It is definitely not Chinese. Let's change it._

image::setcategories-steptwo.png[]
_Figure 2: Notice suggestions for cuisines will pop up. Use arrow keys to select the desired suggestion and press enter,
or you can also choose to continue typing something not in the suggestions._

Step 3: Continue keying in the occasion prefix after you finished keying in the cuisine. The occasion prefix is `oc/`.
Follow Figure 3 shown _below_.

image::setcategories-stepthree.png[]
_Figure 3: Once again, you can pick the occasion you see in the suggestions or continue typing._

Step 4: Key in the price range next, as demonstrated by _Figure 4 below_. The price range prefix is `pr/`.

image::setcategories-stepfour.png[]
_Figure 4: Pick a price range from the list or just type, whichever is faster for you._

Step 5: Press enter and the categories will be set! Else, you might have made a typo somewhere. You should see the
following status message shown in the _Figure below_.

image::setcategories-stepfive.png[]
_Figure 5: Success!_

[NOTE]
====
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed restaurants list.
* You need to ensure that the index entered *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
* You need to ensure that the `Price Range` entered *must* only consist of 1-5 $ characters. e.g. `$`, `$$$`
* You need to ensure that `Cuisine` and `Occasion` *must* only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.
* You do not need to worry about capitalization for `Cuisine` and `Occasion`.
e.g. `fast food` will be capitalized to `Fast Food`.
* You can key in categories in any order. e.g. `Price Range` before `Cuisine`
* You can set any number of categories at once.
====

Other examples you can try:

* `setCategories 2 oc/Premium Casual pr/$` +
Sets the categories of the second restaurant in the list to `Premium Casual` for occasion and
`$` for price range.
* `setCategories 3 c/Western` +
Only sets the cuisine of the third restaurant to `Western`.


==== Filtering restaurants based on category: `filter`

Filters and lists the restaurants with categories matching the keywords entered. +
Format: `filter KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

*Step by step guide on how to filter:*

Step 1: Suppose you want to filter out all `Western`, `Japanese`, as well as `Chinese` restaurants. Type `filter
western japanese chinese` into the command box.

Step 2: Press enter again and now all `Western`, `Japanese` and `Chinese` restaurants will be shown.

[NOTE]
====
* You can enter keywords in any case. Filtering is case insensitive. e.g. `western` will match `Western`
* You can filter across categories and also within categories of the same type. e.g. `japanese $`, `japanese western`
* Keying in more keywords will make the filter more general, not specific.
* You can enter keywords in any order. `$ casual` is the same as `casual $`.
* You *must* enter words in full. e.g. `west` will not match `western`
* Restaurants matching at least one keyword will be displayed. e.g. `fast food` will match `hawker food`
