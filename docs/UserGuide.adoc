== Introduction

*The Real App* is an enhanced Address Book designed primarily for *real estate agents* who need to store large number of client contacts as well as property information.
You can *store* contact details for each of your specialised named clients, as well as essential information for the associated property.
You can *search* for contact information using keywords.
You can *pin* important contacts and even *archive* them when you no longer need them.
*Select* your contact to display the location of the associated property on Google Maps(TM), so you know exactly where it is!

With these and many other features, The Real App is optimized for those who prefer to use a *desktop app* for managing contacts, and *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, The Real App can help you manage all your contact and property information quickly and securely.

Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
