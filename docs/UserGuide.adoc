== Introduction

ClubManager is for Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) leaders who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their members
and activities*. More importantly, ClubManager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ClubManager can get
your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get
started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `clubmanager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ClubManager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* *`memberAdd n/James Ong an/A0123456Y p/98765432 e/jamesong@example.com yos/year1 m/mathematics`* : adds a member named
`John Doe` to the ClubManager.
* *`memberDelete 3`* : deletes the 3rd member shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
