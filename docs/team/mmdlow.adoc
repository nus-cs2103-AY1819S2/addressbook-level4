== PROJECT: Know-It-All

---

== Overview

Know-It-All is a flashcard application developed as a software engineering project by a team of 5, including myself. The base application was originally an addressbook application, and my team was given the choice of either enhancing its current features, or morphing the application to suit a different purpose. We chose the latter path, which resulted in the current iteration of Know-It-All.

Our application aims to assist students in their learning by proving them with an easy-to-use digital flashcard management system to create and review their own flashcards. Through components such as the in-built test session and report feature, users can learn more effectively and review their performance. Interaction is primarily done via a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

My role involved the restructuring of the `model` and `logic` components of the original addressbook application, as well as implementing flashcard creation and management for Know-It-All. A more detailed breakdown of my contributions are detailed below, together with my additions to the user and developer guides.

== Summary of Contributions

|===
|_The section below shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other helpful contributions to the team project._
|===

* *Major enhancement*: I implemented *flashcard creation and management*
** What it does: Allows users to create, edit and delete different kinds of flashcards.
** Justification: This is a core feature of the project, as users will be spending a large portion of their time interacting with the flashcards they have created or imported.
** Highlights:
*** Users can create 2 different types of flashcards, Single-answer cards and MCQ cards. This provides greater versatility in how users choose to structure their learning material through the flashcards.
*** Users can easily convert between both types of cards by simply adding or removing MCQ options.
*** Users have the option to include a hint for each flashcard.

* *Minor enhancement*: I implemented *testing for MCQ cards*
** What it does: For MCQ card tests, users can input a number corresponding to the options available for an MCQ card, instead of having to input the entire answer.
** Justification: This provides greater flexibility in the way users can interact with test sessions. It also reduces the need for users to type in long answers for MCQ questions, where the risk of spelling errors might needlessly impact their score for the card.
** Highlights: MCQ card options are randomized every time the card is tested, thus preventing users from simply memorizing the correct option number.

* *Minor enhancement*: I updated *UI display for cards within card folders and for tests*
** What it does: Changed the display of the side panel for cards within card folders to display all card information to the user.
** Justification:
*** For card folders, the side panel shows users all necessary information of a card at a glance whenever users select a card.
*** For test sessions, only relevant information is shown at the start for each card. The correct answer is displayed only after a user inputs an answer.

** Highlights:
*** In a test session, the card color changes to reflect if a user has answered correctly or not. Green signifies a correct answer, while red signifies a wrong answer.

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_As development of Know-It-All progressed, our team had to concurrently update the User Guide to reflect the changes and new features that we implemented. The section below lists several key excerpts from the User Guide that I contributed to, and showcases my ability to write technical documentation. These include the sections on adding cards and editing cards._
