== PROJECT: RestOrRant

== About the project

RestOrRant is a command line application that my team and I had to work on for a Software Engineering project.
Given a basic code for an address book, we had the choice of enhancing or morphing it into a desktop application that
 caters to specific users' needs.

We decided to morph it into RestOrRant (ROR), a restaurant management application for restaurant managers,
 waiters and cashiers. It is designed for them to perform front-end operations more efficiently like
 managing tables, handling orders, tracking the availability of menu items and calculating statistical data using the
 Command Line Interface (CLI).

RestOrRant is split into 4 main features: Tables, Orders, Menu and Statistics. To cater to needs of the user, modes
are created to make the application user-friendly. *Restaurant Mode*, *Table Mode*, *Menu Mode* and *Statistics Mode*
 are modes meant to handle these 4 features respectively. Each of my teammates are in charge of one feature and mine
 was Statistics. In the following sections, I will elaborate on my
contributions and extract relevant parts from the User Guide and Developer Guide that I wrote for the Statistics
feature.+

== Summary of contributions

Overall, my role in this project encompasses managing the documentation of the project, keeping track the
deadlines and deliverable, enhancing and cleaning up the UI components and Statistics feature.
 You may refer below for a detailed summary of the coding, documentation and other helpful
contributions I have contributed to the team project.

. *Major enhancements:* I add *_Statistics feature_* and its relevant commands.

.. *Calling for bill*: `bill` command
** _What it does:_ It allows users to *calculate and record the total bill* accumulated from the table's order.
** _Justification:_ This feature is necessary to update the restaurant's revenue, status of the specified table and the
quantity of the menu items that were ordered.
** _Highlights:_ This command is only usable in Table Mode.

.. *Changing the Statistics Mode display*: `yearly`, `monthly`, `daily` commands
** _What it does:_ Changes the display to show yearly, monthly and daily *trends of the restaurant's earnings* as
well as the *popularity of the menu items*.
** _Justification:_ This feature allows the restaurant manager to study the restaurant performance. +
These makes it easier for the manager to make essential back-end and front-end management arrangements to cater to the days and
months that receives more customers. +
The popularity of the menu items also helps the manager decide what kind of
prior preparations are needed to cater to the popular dishes.
** _Highlights:_ At most 30 year, months or days along with its revenue are displayed to prevent overflow of data.

.. *Calling for revenue*: `revenue`, `revenue y/YEAR`, `revenue y/YEAR m/MONTH`, `revenue y/YEAR m/MONTH d/DAY`
** What it does: It allows users to *retrieve the required yearly, monthly, daily revenue* the user specifies.
** Justification: This feature allows the restaurant manager to conveniently calculate and obtain the revenue
he/she wants. It also eliminates the possibility of human errors when calculating the revenue.
** Highlights: This command is only usable for day, month, year that are valid and dates that exists in the calendar.
 In the case where no day, month and year are specified, the current day's revenue will be returned.

. *Minor enhancement*: Create a Bill Mode that displays a receipt for the user.

== Contributions to the User Guide

This section shows the contributions that I have made to the User Guide. I have included information about how
the bill and Statistics features work.

|===
|_Even though `bill` is used in Table Mode, its implementation is under the Statistics feature._
|===

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=bill]

You may refer to <<DG, contributions to Developer Guide>> to have a better understanding of `bill` command.

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=smintro]
Here are the commands that you can use in this mode to study the statistical data of your restaurant.

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=daily]

`monthly` and `yearly` commands also work similarly. +

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide.

|===
|_ Since `bill` command is an essential feature in the application, I choose to present it
 in the section below._
|===

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=statisticsclasses]

[NOTE]
Before elaborating on the bill feature, we have to understand the design considerations for statistics storage.

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=statisticsstorage]

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=bill]

|===
|_I have decided to include a brief description of the following commands' implementation as they make up the main
crux of the Statistics Mode._
