As seen in <<duplicate>> below, under *Equipment details* panel, duplicated client details such as name, phone, address could be added and displayed because the details refer to a client's details who owns multiple equipment as long as the serial numbers of equipment are different. +
Under *Client details* panel, duplicated client names will not appear in the panel because the *Client details* panel will only show distinct number of clients in the *Equipment Manager*.


Example:

The following shows user adding 1 equipment that is owned by the client called Serangoon CC.

* `add-e n/Serangoon CC p/64738499 pm/11-06-2019 a/10 Serangoon North Ave 2, Singapore 555877 s/A0293838X t/northeast`
