* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

CAUTION: Please ensure that you have the permissions to Read, Write and
Execute the files that you wish to manage through our application. Please use
a web search, like Google, to assist you in identifying if you possess the
permissions. If you are lacking these permissions our application may not be
able to carry out the actions specified by you.

WARNING: Please do not manipulate the files once you have added them to our
application. Unforeseen actions such as moving, renaming and others might result
in unexpected behaviour by the application. Our application is meant to replace
the need for you to perform these actions manually on your files yourselves.
