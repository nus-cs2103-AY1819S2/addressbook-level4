== PROJECT: UniLA

---

== Overview

UniLA is a desktop utilities application designed for university students who are typing oriented to easily manage their contact and event lists. The application is primarily concerned with CLI (Command Line Interface) Interaction, with a simple and intuitive GUI provided.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: upgrade the *find command* and implement *findE command*

** What it does: These two commands support different search patterns. The `find` allows users to search for people in contact list easily. Users can search a person through exact keyword match, fuzzy keyword match and wildcard keyword match.
The `findE` command allows users to search for events in event list. Users can search for an event through exact keyword match, search for events before, on or after a certain date, and search for the event with a certain duration.
** Justification: This feature is important and efficient for users to manage a large list of contacts and events.
** Highlights: The enhancement and implementation involves reorganizing different classes, adding new predicates classes and command classes. The implementation is challenging because different search patterns are used and the optimal algorithm is chosen after a detailed analysis of the alternatives.
** Credits: Levenshtein Distance is used to calculate the similarity between keywords. [https://www.cnblogs.com/ivanyb/archive/2011/11/25/2263356.html[Original Blogger]]
