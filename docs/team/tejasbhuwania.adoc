== PROJECT: HMS+

This project portfolio documents my individual contributions to the HMS+ project. It includes an overview of the project,
 the summary of the features that I have implemented and my contributions to other features of the project.
Some extracts of my documentation from the HMS+ User Guide and Developer Guide have also been included.

== Project Overview

The purpose of the project was to prepare us for the real world. The project was structured in a way that it resembled an intermediate stage of a non-trivial real-life software project. We had to optimize or morph an already existing AddressBook into a different product. Through this, we learned how to conceptualize and implement enhancements to a given product so that it could be used by future developers.

== Application Overview

HMS+ is a computer application that targets all the hotels around the world. It aims to make the life of the hotel management staff easy by giving them a single, integrated, and highly customizable hotel management system so that the tedious process of running a hotel can be made easier and more effective.

Since HMS+ is for those who prefer using the keyboard over a mouse, it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) for input. However, all the output is displayed in a traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) - which is just a computer jargon for a display that includes panes, menus and message boxes. This has been done to keep the user engaged.

*Main Features* :

* Simple customer database management.
* Effortless service booking and room reservation management.
* Easy bill management.
* Highly customizable services and room types.

== Summary of contributions

This section encompasses an overview of all the  enhancements I implemented in HMS+. I have encapsulated in a nutshell how
each of these augmentations adds value to the overall system in order to enable it to run in a more efficient manner.

* *Major enhancement*: This enhancement added the functionality to generate bills for the customers by the hotel management
staff.
** [underline]#What it does#: It allows the hotel staff to generate booking bills, reservation bills and the total bill for the customers.
** [underline]#Justification#: Generally, hotels give a large number of bills in quantity to the customer to pay. This makes it very
confusing for the customer to understand and pay the bills. This is also a very tedious task for the hotel management staff
as they have to keep track of all customer spendings at the hotel at all times and make sure everything is accounted for.
The `generate-bill` commands implemented do all this in one go making the lives of the customers and the hotel management staff
easier.
** [underline]#Highlights#: This enhancement is an end-to-end feature that allows the hotel staff to generate bills for a specific customer, a specific booking or a specific reservation. I had to make sure that I use the already implemented reservation and booking models while creating the newer bill model. I also had to make sure that this model has access to all bookings and reservations simultaneously so that it could generate the bill based on the command entered by the user.
** [underline]#Credits#: I mainly used the concepts from the existing codebase and those that were taught in CS2103T to implement my features.
** [underline]#Related Files#:

* *Minor enhancements*:
1. [underline]#Find Reservation Command#: This enhancement added the functionality that the hotel management staff can easily
find a specific room reservation.
** What it does: It allows the hotel staff to find a specific room reservation done by the customer based on the
customer's Identification Number or Room Type or Dates of Reservation or all of the above.
** Justification: Whenever the hotel staff needs to edit or delete a specific reservation, he or she needs to go through the entire reservation list to find that specific booking. This is a tedious process. Through the `FindReservationCommand`, the hotel staff can find the specific reservation in one go thereby reducing his or her workload.
** Highlights: This enhancement is an end-to-end feature that allows the hotel staff to find specific bookings based on three filters - customer’s Identification number, the Room Type and the Dates of Reservation. While implementing this I had to ensure that I use the already placed prefixes so that it does not become confusing for the staff to handle too many prefixes and that the command is easy enough for them to use.

[appendix]
== Other sections in the User Guide

This section contains all my other additions to User Guide which will help the user understand the software and use it
more efficiently.

=== A.1 Prefix List

The Prefix List was added by me keeping in mind that our software has a large number of prefixes and it might become confusing
for the user as to which prefix to use when. This list will help the users understand which prefix to use when and the constraints
that each of the prefixes have.

The extract shown below is just an excerpt from the Prefix List and not the entire glossary. To see the full list refer to
https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#5-prefix-list[Prefix List in User Guide].

[appendix]
== Other sections in the Developer Guide

This section contains all my other additions to the Developer Guide which will help the incoming developers understand the
motives behind the software and how they all fit well together into a single product. This well help them dive into the software
with full preparation and work on it in an efficient manner.

=== B.1 Glossary

The Glossary section was added by me to help the developers understand the different terms used in the Developer Guide.
In case, a developer is unsure about a specific term he/she can easily refer to it in the glossary and understand what it means.

The extract shown below is just an excerpt from the Glossary and not the entire list. To see the full list refer to

==== Storage Component Diagram

I also updated the `Storage Component Diagram` to make it represent the current stage of Storage. The current stage of Storage
can be seen below:

== Achievements and Learnings

* Learned how to work on a large code base with more 10000 lines of code.
* Learned how to effectively work in a team when everyone is working on the same project.
