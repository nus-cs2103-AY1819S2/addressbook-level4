== PROJECT: Acquizition

This project portfolio documents my contributions towards Acquizition, a team project under a software engineering module in NUS, known as CS2103T.

The purpose of this portfolio is to summarize the features that I have implemented, as well as some excerpts of the User and Developer Guide that I have written.

---

== Overview

Acquizition is a desktop flashcard application for subject revision and language acquisition.

Using a scientifically-grounded SRS (Spaced Repetition System), Acquizition maximizes memory retention by testing the terms most likely to be forgotten soon.

Created with JavaFX, Acquizition has a sleek and intuitive GUI (Graphical User Interface) to streamline the experience for new users, but also sports a CLI (Command Line Interface) to maximize the efficiency of power users. It is written in Java and has around 14k lines of code.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the complete quiz mode*, including the full GUI and quiz backend commands. +
The quiz GUI includes the flashcard card view pane on the right, and the quiz panel on the left. +
The quiz commands includes `quiz`, `good` feedback, `bad` feedback, and smart command.

** What it does: allows the user to conveniently test and keep track their understanding of the flashcards inside the card collection
** Justification:
*** This feature improves the product significantly as it is the main feature that Acquizition offers.
*** It can do seamless swapping between the quiz UI and the card collection UI
*** It also contains a smart command feature where the user can quickly navigate through the cards without having to type redundant commands.
** Highlights:
*** This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, since the quiz mode needs seamless swapping of the card collection GUI and the quiz mode GUI.
*** The implementation too was challenging as separation of different modes and interaction of logic and dynamic UI parts is needed.
** Credits: I learned and applied concepts from CS2103T and the existing codebase.
** Related code: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-2/main/pull/46[Advanced Quiz Mode], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-2/main/pull/27[Flashcard Card View]

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Replaces the menu bar with a much more intuitive toolbar. Since menu bar only supports exit and help, moving it to the toolbar with just those two buttons is more reasonable.
*** Related code: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-2/main/pull/49[Toolbar]
** Modifies the existing person model to flashcard model, including all of its components.
*** Related code: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-2/main/pull/22[Refactor Flashcard Fields]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Set up Github repository and https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-2/main/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Asergiovieri[issues]
*** https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-T12-2/main/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Asergiovieri+is%3Aclosed[Reviewed and approved several PRs]
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated the GUI color scheme
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage
** Code contributed: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=Ser[Reposense]
** Tools:
*** Set Up Travis, AppVeyor, Coveralls, and Codacy
*** Set Up GithubPages
*** Set the minimum requirements for code to be merged to master.
