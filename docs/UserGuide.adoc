== Introduction

Ships ahoy! Battleships is a retro game for people who want to have the joy of playing Battleships without the hassle and fuss of a physical game.

Battleships is optimised for people who want to use a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It can guarantee many hours of fun, especially between those long and boring periods of the day. Can't wait to get started? Head over to <<Quick Start>> to fire away!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all battleships
* **`put`**`a1` : Puts a battleship with its head at the A1 cell
* **`play`** : Start the game
* **`shoot`**`a1` : Attacks the enemy's A1 cell
* *`exit`* : exits the app

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Opens a help window that displays this User Guide. +
Format: `help`

=== Map : `init`

Initialises both player's maps to the specified size. +
Format: `init MAP_SIZE` +
Example: `init 10`

_Figure 1_ below shows how the maps will be displayed in the UI.

.Player and enemy maps

Throughout the course of the game, the cells in the map will change colour based on their status. +

[NOTE]
====
.Cell statuses:
- Hidden - Enemy map cell that has not been hit
- Water - Empty (i.e cell with no ship) player cell that has not been hit
- Water Hit - Empty cell that has been hit
- Ship - Player cell that has a ship and has not been hit
- Ship Hit - Ship cell that has been hit but not yet destroyed
- Ship Destroyed - Ship cell that has been destroyed
====

_Figure 2_ below shows which colour is used for each status.

=== Placing a ship on the map: `put`

Adds a battleship onto the player's map. The coordinates specified is the position of the battleship's head. +

Format: `put n/NAME c/COORDINATES r/ORIENTATION t/TAG` +

Examples:

* `put n/Destroyer c/a1 r/vertical`
* `put n/Aircraft Carrier c/b1 r/h` +

The head of the battleship is the top-most and left-most part of the ship. _Figure 3_ shows how a battleship is put at coordinate `a5`. The head of the battleship is therefore at `a5`. +

.The `put` command will put the battleship at a5, which is the battleship's head coordinate.
image::putshipheadexample.png[width=750]

The orientation of the battleship can be horizontal or vertical. The orientation of the battleship must be specified. It may be shortened to `h` or `v`. +

=== Listing all ships : `list`

Shows a list of all the player's battleships that are have been deployed on the map. There are four ways of using the `list` command:

1. List all the battleships.
1. List all the battleships that match a list of tags.
1. List all the battleships of a certain type.
1. List all the battleships of a certain type that match a list of tags.

Format:

* `list`
* `list t/[TAGS]`
* `list n/[NAME]`
* `list n/[NAME] t/[TAGS]`

Examples:

* `list`
* `list t/blueFleet`
* `list n/destroyer`
* `list n/destroyer t/blueFleet`

The list will show the battleship's head coordinate, the battleship's orientation, and the battleship's tags in square brackets. +

The format of each entry in the list is: `[NAME] [CURRENT LIFE] at [HEAD COORDINATE] [ORIENTATION] [TAGS]`.

.The `list` command
image::listexample.png[width=750]

The `list` command can also be used with tags. In the example provided, we have added the tag `bluefleet` to our destroyer at `f7`. Using the command `list t/bluefleet` will allow us to list all the battleships tagged with `bluefleet`.

.The `list` command with tags
image::listwithtagexample.png[width=750]

The `list` command can be used with both the name of the battleship and a list of tags. In this example from _Figure 6_ and _Figure 7_, we have created a fleet with two tags: `blue` and `green`.

.The `list` command showing our fleet
image::listall.png[width=750]

We are able to list a specific battleship by the name of `destroyer` with the tag `blue`, as in _Figure 7_.

=== Locating ships by name: `find`

Finds battleships whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find NAME [MORE_NAMES]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hood` will match `Hood`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Wales Prince` will match `Prince Of Wales`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Bel` will not match `Belfast`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). +
e.g. `King York` will return `King George V`, `Duke of York`
****

Examples:

* `find Vengeance` +
Returns `Name: RSS Vengeance, Size: 4, Command: true, Position: d2`

[NOTE]
The position may not be displayed if the ship has not been placed.

=== List all tags: `listTags`

Lists all the tags that have been used to tag the battleships deployed on the map. +


Format: `listTags` +
Examples: `listTags`

[NOTE]
The list of tags is given in square brackets.

=== Selecting a ship : `select`

Selects the battleship identified by the index number used in the displayed ship list. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed ship list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd battleship in the inventory.
* `find Prinz Eugen` +
`select 1` +
Selects the 1st battleship in the results of the `find` command.

=== Starting a game: `play`

Starts a game of Battleship with a computer enemy. +
Format: `play`

Example:

* `play`

=== Shooting at a coordinate: `shoot`

Launches an attack against given coordinate on the enemy's map. +
Format: `shoot COORDINATES`

Example:

* `shoot A6`

****
* The program will prevent an attack on an invalid coordinate..
* The program will prevent an attack on a square that has already been attacked.
****

=== Starts Enemy's turn: `enemyturn`

Ends Player turn and starts Enemy's turn. +
Format: `enemyturn`

****
* The program will end the player's turn and automatically play the Enemy's turns, until the Player's next turn.
While that is happening, the player can see the enemy's attacks reflected on the map.
****

=== Retrieving game statistics: `stats`

Prints a list of statistics related to gameplay, such as accuracy and current hits. +
Format: `stats`

Example:

* `stats`

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the inventory to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the inventory's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the inventory. +
Format: `clear`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`
