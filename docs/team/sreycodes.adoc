== PROJECT: HMS+

|===
|This portfolio serves to document my contributions and learning while building HMS+
|===

== Overview

HMS+ is a hotel management system made for hotels to manage their customers and their relevant transactions.
The hotel staff interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and has around 15,000 lines of code.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|This section summarizes my contributions to the application and explains their importance.
|===

* *Major enhancement*: I added the complete backend for the booking and reservation from commands up to storage.
This also includes making sure each component is customizable which involved refactoring service and room types
from `ENUM` to classes.
** What it does: It allows the hotel staff to add service-bookings, reservations, service types and room types to the hotel.
** Justification: This is the backbone of the application as these are the main amenities of any hotel. Most other
functionality such as bill and statistics can work because of these models.
** Highlights: This enhancement required in-depth analysis of the codebase as it involved extending a single-model dependent system to a multi-model based system.
I had to make sure the design implementation preserved the extensibility of the system as well as allowed the different components to interact with each other.
** Credits: I mainly used the concepts from the existing codebase and those that were taught in CS2103T to implement my features.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Set the design structure for the implementation of future models.
*** Created utility classes to handle timings and date intervals with
https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/hms/model/util/TimeRangeTest.java[relevant tests].
** Documentation:
*** Added command formats and descriptions to the user guide.
*** Added color-coding to the user guide.
*** Reformatted all the commands to match an intuitive convention in guides and codebase.
*** Added sections to developer guide.
https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#41-adding-service-booking-functionality[Example]- I
added a section to teach oncoming developers how to add new models to the codebase.
** Tools:
*** Set Up Travis, Codacy and Coveralls
*** Set the minimum requirements for code to be merged to master.
