== Introduction

Pocket Project is primarily an application for software engineering project managers who are currently in-charge of
a team of large employees and many projects. This application employs the use of a Command Line Interface(CLI) to easily
navigate through the application which contributes to the efficiency and user-friendliness of the end product.
This application allows managers to keep track of all the employees and their related background information such as their
GitHub account username and relevant skills.

Additionally, it also helps to keep track of all the projects that the manager
is currently involved with and key details of the project such the client, deadline and milestones can also be stored.
Through the combination of the two main components, the application allows the storing and viewing of all the employees
working on particular project and all the projects currently under a single employee among other functionalities.

== Background Information

When first seeing our application, many of you may wonder what is the significance
behind this project. Well, the current issues cannot be seen at the surface level and requires
a deeper look. To present all the information in a nutshell, our application provides
everything that a manager will ever need at the tip of his fingertips. Being able to better
handle project and man management leads to a more organized workflow and inevitably, a more
productive environment which can set a strong foundation for the lifecycle of various projects.

In addition, the inability to track the progress of a project has been cited as one of the top reasons
as to why a product fails, and thus our application aims to potentially solve this problem
by having both a milestones feature and a task manager to mainly see not only what has been completed, but
also the proposed schedule for the weeks ahead until the project is due for completion.

== Before We Begin
This section will outline key things to take note of before reading the user guide.
The information provided in this section will be useful in understanding certain
symbols and terms used further on in the user guide.

The following section will outline the various features and commands available to you and will
outline how the various commands can be used through examples and illustrations.

=== Viewing help : `help`

You can open up the User Guide from the Pocket Project application by calling the `help` command.

Format: `help`

[width="1000",cols="100,<900"]
|===
|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]|Alternatively, you can press kbd:[F1]
or click `Help` which can be found on the menu bar at the top left hand corner of the application.
|===

.*Accessing help from menu bar*
image::ug-helpcommand.png[width="400"]

// tag::datefeature[]
=== Date Feature in Pocket Project

Whenever a particular command requires a date field, you can choose to use either of the
below mentioned formats.

==== Fixed Date Format

You can input a date using the fixed date format. +
Format: `DD/MM/YYYY`

Examples: +
1. `23/12/2019` +
2. `09/03/2020`

[width="300",cols="100,<200"]
|===
|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]| The year field will not accept values beyond the
year `2099` and acts as a loose safety feature for accidental errors while inputting the year.
|===

==== Flexible Date Format

Alternatively, you can also input a date using the flexible date format. The flexible date format
allows you to give an input with relation to the current date. It supports the below mentioned 3 formats.

*Choosing a date relative to the current day* +
You can key in `today`,`tomorrow` and `yesterday` to get today's, tomorrow's and
yesterday's date respectively.

Format: `today/tomorrow/yesterday`

*Choosing a date relative to the current week*
You can also aim to choose a date with relation to the current week. +
Format: `this/next/last week DAY_OF_WEEK`

[width="300",cols="100,<200"]
|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]|The `DAY_OF_WEEK` takes an integer in the range of 1 to 7 which
corresponds to Monday to Sunday respectively.
|===

Examples: +
1. `next week 7` +
This would select next week's Sunday as the target date. +
2. `last week 2` +
This would select last week's Tuesday as the target date.

You can refer to the screenshots of the program below for a clearer picture. Assume that the
current date is 12 April 2019 (12/04/2019), Friday.  It will be demonstrated using the `add project` command which requires
a `s/START_DATE` and a `d/DEADLINE`.

.*Using "this/next/last week DAY_OF_WEEK" as a flexible date input*
image::ug-dateweek.png[][width="500"]

*Choosing a date relative to the current month*

You can also aim to choose a date with relation to the current week. +
Format: `this/next/last month DAY_OF_MONTH`

[width="300",cols="100,<200"]
|===
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]|The `DAY_OF_MONTH` takes the value of positive integer but it cannot exceed
the maximum number of days of a particular month in the chosen year.
|===

Examples: +
1. `this month 24` +
This would select the current month's 24th day as the target date. +
2. `next month 17` +
This would select next month's 17th day as the target date.
// end::datefeature[]

[width="300",cols="100,<200"]
|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]|You do not need to specify which format you are planning to use and the application
is able to differentiate it based on the input received.
|===

===== Some additional information
The application will also automatically help to check the validity of the target
date. Should you accidentally target an invalid dates such as `31/04/2019`, it will be rejected as the month of April
only has 30 days. Additionally, leap years are also considered. So, as 2020 is a leap year, `29/02/2020` is considered a valid input but `29/02/2019` will be rejected
as 2019 is not a leap year.




=== Adding an employee or project to the application: `add`

// tag::addemployeefeature[]
==== Adding an employee to the application: `add employee`

You can add an employee to the Pocket Project when a new employee joins the company/team
so that the key details of the employee are stored in the application and projects can be assigned to
them in the future.

Format: `add employee n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL g/GITHUB_ACCOUNT_USERNAME [s/SKILL]...`

Examples:

. `add employee n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com g/johnballer s/Java`
. `add employee n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com g/BetBet p/98228312`

[width="1000",cols="100,<900"]
|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]|An employee can have any number of skills (including 0).
|===

You can refer to the screenshot below to have a clearer picture of how it works
and looks like.

.*Adding an employee to the application and what we can do with it*
image::ug-addemployee.png[]


In addition, as a software engineering project manager, you may want to easily access an employee's GitHub repository
to possibly monitor his progress on a particular project. Thus for ease of use, you can simply toggle the arrow as shown
above in Step 5 of Figure 5 and the GitHub repository of the employee will be viewable and accessible in the details panel.

[width="1000",cols="100,<900"]
|===
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]|A working Internet connection is required to see and navigate through the GitHub
repository. Otherwise, the page will not load.
|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]|You can also view the list of all projects assigned to the employee
by toggling the arrows on the details panel.
|===

// end::addemployeefeature[]

// tag::addprojectfeature[]
==== Add a project to the application: `add project`

You can add a project to the Pocket Project when the team takes on a new project
so that key details of the project are stored and employees, milestones, tasks and user stories
can be assigned to them in the future.

The project has a default description when created and this can be
edited using the `edit project info` command.

Format: `add project n/NAME c/CLIENT_NAME s/START_DATE d/DEADLINE`

[width="300",cols="100,<200"]
|===
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]|The deadline of the project should minimally be 1 day after the
start of a project.
|===

Examples: +
1. `add project n/Apollo s/10/03/2019 d/12/12/2019 c/FairPrice` +
2. `add project n/Xtreme c/John Smith s/09/02/2020 d/13/04/2020`

You can refer to the screenshot below to have a clearer picture of how it works
and looks like.

.*Adding a project to the application and what we can do with it*

=== Add an employee/milestone/project task/user story to a project : `addto`


[width="1000",cols="100,<900"]
|===
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="70"]|
Note that 'milestone', 'userstory', 'projecttask' are reserved words so they are not accepted as part of the argument for the description of respective components
|===


// tag::addemployee[]

==== Add an employee to a project: `addto employee`

You can add an employee to any projects already created in the Pocket Project application. You can
do this by first listing all employees using the basic `list employees` command or by first filtering all the
employees with the `find employee` or `find skills` command, and then choosing the index of the employee
in the displayed list.

Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME employee EMPLOYEE_INDEX`

The employee at the specified `EMPLOYEE_INDEX` is added to the project specified by the `PROJECT_NAME`.

[width="300",cols="100,<200"]
|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]| The index refers to the serial number (one-based indexing) shown in
the displayed list of employees.
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]| The `EMPLOYEE_INDEX` must be a positive integer and cannot be
larger than the size of the displayed list.
|===

Examples:

. `list employees` technique
.. `list employees` +
lists all the employees in the application.
.. `addto Apollo employee 2` +
Adds the 2nd person in the displayed employee list to project "Apollo".

. `find employee` technique
.. `find employee John Han` +
The displayed list will be filtered to show all employees whose names contain John, Han (not case sensitive).
.. `addto Apollo employee 5` +
Adds the 5th person in the displayed filtered employee list to project "Apollo".

You can refer to the screenshot below to have a clearer picture of how it works
and looks like.

.*Adding an employee to a project*
image::ug-addtoemployee.png[]


[width="300",cols="100,<200"]
|===
|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]| As shown in the figure above, instead of calling
the `list employees` command, we can simple click on the `employees` tab located at the top of the side tab panel.
|===

// end::addemployee[]

// tag::addmilestone[]
==== Add a milestone to a project: `addto milestone`

You can add a milestone to any projects already created in the Pocket Project application. Milestones are typically
key events that are completed during the entire timeline of the project. Once a milestone is
created, project tasks can be assigned to it.


Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME milestone m/MILESTONE_DESC d/MILESTONE_DATE`


[width="300",cols="100,<200"]
|===
|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]|Both the fixed date format and the flexible date format
can be used to select the target `MILESTONE_DATE`. Refer to <<Date Feature in Pocket Project>>
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]| As the milestone is part of a project's timeline, the
`MILESTONE_DATE` the input date cannot be before the `START_DATE` and after `DEADLINE` of the project.
|===

Examples:

. `addto Apollo milestone m/Completed UI for program d/23/11/2015` +
The milestone with the given description and the date 23/11/2015 will be added to the list
of milestones in project "Apollo".
. `addto Orbital milestone m/Version 1.3 Complete d/today`
The milestone with the given description and today's date will be added to the list
of milestones in project "Orbital".

[width="300",cols="100,<200"]
|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]| The list of milestones inside the target project
will automatically be sorted by its date every time a new entry is added.
|===

You can refer to the screenshot below to have a clearer picture of how it works
and looks like.

.*Adding a milestone to a project*

// end::addmilestone[]


//tag::daryl[]


==== Add a project task to a project's milestone: `addto projecttask`

Building further on the functionality of milestones, you can also add project tasks to existing milestones in Pocket Project.
This allows you to track and plan out in more detail what needs to be done between each milestone.

Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME projecttask n/PROJECT_TASK_DESCRIPTION m/MILESTONE_INDEX`

[width="1000",cols="100,<900"]
|===
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="50"]| The `MILESTONE_INDEX` must be a positive integer and cannot be
larger than the size of the displayed milestone list.
|===

Examples:

. `addto Apollo projecttask n/Create feature XYZ m/1` +
   A project task with the given description will be added to the list of tasks under the milestone at index 1 in project "Apollo".
. `addto Orbital projecttask m/2 n/Prepare concept design sketches` +
   A project task with the given description will be added to the list of tasks under the milestone at index 2 in project "Orbital".

[width="1000",cols="100,<900"]
|===
|image:ug-lightbulb.png[width="50"]|There is no specific order for either the project task name or the milestone index when entering the command so either way is acceptable.
|===

You can refer to the screenshot below to have a clearer picture of how it works and looks like.

.*Adding a task to a project's milestone*
image::ug-addprojecttask.png[]

[width="1000",cols="100,<900"]
|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]| Clicking on the arrow beside a milestone containing existing tasks allows you
to hide the list of tasks under the milestone.
|===
//end::daryl[]

// tag::adduserstory[]

==== Add a user story to a project: `addto userstory`

You can add a user story to a project. User stories are tools used in software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective.

Format: `addto PROJECT_NAME userstory i/STORY_IMPORTANCE STORY`

[width="1000",cols="100,<900"]
|===
|image:ug-notepadpencil.png[width="40"]| `STORY_IMPORTANCE`: The priority/importance level of the user story, ranging from 1 to 3. 3 being the most
important and 1 being the least.
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="40"]| `STORY`:  `as a`, `i want to` and `so that` are keywords which help us to segment your user story into the respective categories: user, function and reason. Hence these keywords cannot be used more than once and needs to be included in a valid user story.
|===

Examples:

. `addto Apollo userstory as a new user i want to have a clean UI so that i can navigate easily i/2`

. `addto Apollo userstory i/1 as a user i want to try out new things so that i can have fun`

[width="1000",cols="100,<900"]
|===
|image:ug-smart.png[width="40"]| You can input the importance level or the actual user story in any order.
|image:ug-smart.png[width="40"]| A valid user story can also be simply: `as a ... i want to...`.

E.g `as a user i want to log in` is a valid user story.
|===

Upon a successful addition of a user story, you should be able to see the new user story in the list of user stories.
You may need to toggle the buttons to get to the correct panel.

Refer to the screenshot below to see how the new user story is shown.

Both the fixed date format and the flexible date can be used here to edit the deadline.
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="70"]|
Note that the start date is unmodifiable and the deadline should be after the start date of the project and
also after the date of the latest milestone in the project.
|image:ug-exclamation.png[width="70"]|
Note that 'info' is a reserved word so it is not accepted as part of the argument for the description of the project (e.g. 'm/project info' is not accepted).
|===
