== Introduction

Hey there! image:mascot.png[width="120"]

_Acquizition_ is a *desktop app* for easy language acquisition
using flashcards. It analyzes your performance on recalling words
or phrases, and, based on how well you do, decides which word or
phrase to show you next to maximize learning.

Additionally, _Acquizition_ provides you with a user-friendly
Graphical User Interface (GUI) to view your flashcards. It even
supports images on the flashcards to make them more memorable. If
you can type quickly, you will surely also enjoy the Command-Line
Interface (CLI), streamlined for users like you.

This user guide begins with an in-depth documentation on the
_Acquizition_ installation process. We structured the user guide
to cater to your needs by explaining common use cases, rather than
simply giving a list of commands and command formats.

Of course, you can still access the concise command summary at the
end of this document if you need it for reference.

Time is money, so jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started immediately.

We hope you enjoy _Acquizition_, and we wish you the best in your
language studies!

== Quick Start

.  Make sure that you have **Java 9** or later installed on your computer.
    * On **Windows 10**, you can check your Java version by searching for _Apps & features_
    and looking for Java. +
    image:java_version_windows.png[width="790"]
    * On **Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)** and above, you can check your Java version by searching
    for _System Preferences_ and looking for the Java icon, then clicking on it. +
    image:java_version_mac.png[width="790"]
    * This process may be different on other operating systems. Please search online for the relevant process.
[NOTE]
**Note:** If you do not have Java installed, or your version is outdated, you can
download the latest version by following the instructions https://www.java.com/en/download/[here].
.  Download the latest `acquizition.zip` file link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the downloaded `acquizition.zip` file to the directory of your choice, and extract the `acquizition.zip` file there.
[TIP]
**Tip:** Most operating systems should have built-in support for extracting `.zip` files. The process may differ between
operating systems. Please search online for the relevant process.
.  Locate the `acquizition.jar` file and double-click it to start _Acquizition_. The app should appear on your
screen in a few seconds.
[TIP]
**Tip:** If you do not see anything after a few seconds, you may need to open _Acquizition_ through
the command line. To do this, open the Command Prompt, Terminal or Linux Shell. Then, type `cd`,
followed by a space, followed by the directory of the folder containing `acquizition.jar`, and press kbd:[Enter].
Then, type `java -jar acquizition.jar`, and press kbd:[Enter]. The app should appear on your screen in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Try typing the following commands. Press kbd:[Enter] after typing a command to tell _Acquizition_
to execute it.
[NOTE]
**Note:** Commands are _case-sensitive_: please type the commands _exactly_ as shown!

* `add f/Kamusta b/Hello t/Tagalog` : Creates a flashcard with _Kamusta_ on the
front and _Hello_ on the back, with the tag _Tagalog_.
* `add f/Terima kasih b/Thank you t/BahasaIndonesia` : Creates a flashcard with
_Terima kasih_ on the front and _Thank you_ on the back, with the tag _Bahasa
Indonesia_.
* `find b/Thank you` : lists all flashcards whose back face shows _Thank you_.
* `delete 2` : deletes the second flashcard in the collection.
* `exit` : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> and <<FeaturesQuiz>> for the detailed descriptions of
each command.

[[Features]]
== Features (Collection)

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` should be substituted by you!
    ** Example: In `add f/FRONT_TEXT b/BACK TEXT`, `FRONT_TEXT` and `BACK_TEXT`
    should be replaced to, say, `Kamusta` and `Hello`. So, you could write
    `add f/Kamusta b/Hello`.
* Words in `[square brackets]` are optional.
    ** Example: In `add f/FRONT_TEXT b/BACK_TEXT [i/IMAGE_PATH]`, `IMAGE_PATH`
    is optional. You can replace it with, say, `add f/Babae b/Woman i/images/woman.png`.
* Words with `...` after them can be specified multiple times.
    ** Example: In `add f/FRONT_TEXT b/BACK_TEXT [t/TAG]...`, `TAG` is optional
    and you can specify multiple tags. You can replace it with, say, `add f/Lalaki b/Man
    t/Tagalog t/Noun`.
* You can specify the parameters in any order; if the command specifies `f/FRONT_TEXT
b/BACK_TEXT`, you can also type them in the order `b/BACK_TEXT f/FRONT_TEXT`.
====

=== How do I add a flashcard?

You can add a flashcard by using the `add` command.

Type `​add f/FRONT_TEXT b/BACK_TEXT [i/IMAGE_NAME] [t/TAG]​...​` into the command box and
press kbd:[Enter].

The `FRONT_TEXT` is the prompt you see, and the `BACK_TEXT` is what you need to recall.

[TIP]
**Tip:** A flashcard can optionally have a single image on its front face. You should specify this
image through the use of the `IMAGE_NAME`, which is the name of your image (with the extension)
after importing it through the `image` command. +
See <<AddCardImage>> for more details.

[TIP]
**Tip:** Although tags are not strictly required, we highly recommend using them, especially if you intend
to study multiple languages. Most of the other features in _Acquizition_ are compatible with
working with specific tags. For example, if you are learning both Chinese and Japanese and want to
study only the Chinese flashcards, you can do that if you have tagged all the Chinese flashcards with, for
example, `t/Chinese`.

[NOTE]
**Note:** Tags must be alphanumeric; in particular, they cannot contain spaces. For example,
`t/Bahasa Indonesia` is forbidden; use `t/BahasaIndonesia` instead.

**Examples:**

* `add f/Kamusta b/Hello t/Tagalog` +
This adds a flashcard whose front face is _Kamusta_, whose back face is _Hello_, and has the
tag _Tagalog_.
* `add f/さようなら b/Goodbye i/goodbye.jpg t/Japanese t/Greetings` +
This adds a flashcard whose front face is _さようなら_, whose back face is _Goodbye_, has the image
`goodbye.jpg` on its front face, and has the tags _Japanese_ and _Greetings_.

[[AddCardImage]]
=== How do I add a flashcard with an image?

_Acquizition_ uses a local storage system to store your images. This means that to add an
image, you first need to _import_ it into _Acquizition_. This benefits you, because that means
once you add an image to _Acquizition_, you can move or even delete the original image and
Acquizition will still have a copy of your image!

To import an image, you can use the `image` command.

Type `image IMAGE_PATH​` into the command box and press kbd:[Enter].

[TIP]
**Tip:** What is an `IMAGE_PATH`? It is the _absolute path_ to your image. For example, if you
have an image called `everest.jpg` on your Desktop, the `IMAGE_PATH` might be `C:\Users\Robin\Desktop\everest.jpg`. +
On Windows, you can get the absolute path by right-clicking on the image, selecting _Properties_, and copying the
path under _Location:_. Then, append a backslash and the image filename (with the extension) to the end. +
image:image_filepath.png[width="790"] +
In the image above, we see that the path under _Location:_ is `C:\Users\Robin\Desktop`. We append a backslash `\`
and the image filename `everest` with the extension `.jpg` to get the `IMAGE_PATH` which is
`C:\Users\Robin\Desktop\everest.jpg`. +
This process may be different on other operating systems. Please search online for the relevant process.

After importing an image into _Acquizition_, you can now directly refer to the imported image by the filename
(with the extension).

Type `​add f/FRONT_TEXT b/BACK_TEXT i/IMAGE_NAME [t/TAG]​...​` into the command box and
press kbd:[Enter]. `IMAGE_NAME` is the filename of the image you just imported.

**Example:**

* {blank}
. `image C:\Users\Robin\Desktop\everest.jpg` +
This imports the image located at `C:\Users\Robin\Desktop` into _Acquizition_,
as previously described.
. `add f/珠峰 b/Mount Everest i/everest.jpg t/Chinese` +
This adds a flashcard whose front face is _珠峰_, whose back face is _Mount Everest_, has the
image `everest.jpg` (which we just imported) on its front face, and has the tag _Chinese_.

[[DeleteCard]]
=== How do I delete a flashcard?

You can delete a flashcard by using the `delete` command.

Type `delete INDEX` and press kbd:[Enter].

Note that `INDEX` refers to the number of the card on the _currently-visible_ list. This is the list
you see on the left-side panel.

**Example:**

* `delete 3` +
This deletes the third flashcard.

=== How do I delete all flashcards at once?

If, for whatever reason, you want to delete all the flashcards at once, you can do so using the `clear` command.

Type `clear` and press kbd:[Enter].

[[EditCard]]
=== How do I edit a flashcard?

You can edit a flashcard by using the `edit` command.

Type `edit INDEX [f/FRONT_TEXT] [b/BACK_TEXT] [i/IMAGE_NAME] [t/TAG]​...​` into the command box and
press kbd:[Enter].

Note that `INDEX` refers to the number of the card on the _currently-visible_ list. This is the list
you see on the left-side panel.

You must specify at least one of `[f/FRONT_TEXT]`, `[b/BACK_TEXT]`, `[i/IMAGE_NAME]`, and `[t/TAG]​`,
and you can specify more than one. The edit command will change _only_ the specified items, and leave
all the others unchanged.

[NOTE]
**Note:** When specifying one or more `TAG`(s), _all existing tags_ will be removed. If you want to add a new tag,
you must restate all the previous tags and add the new one.

[NOTE]
**Note:** For more information about the `IMAGE_NAME`, see <<AddCardImage>>.

**Examples:**

* `edit 3 b/Hello` +
This changes the third card to have a back face _Hello_.
* `edit 2 t/Navajo` +
This removes all the tags from the second card and adds the tag _Navajo_.
* `edit 1 f/麒麟 b/きりん i/kirin.png t/Japanese t/Kanji` +
This changes the first card to have a front face _麒麟_, a back face _きりん_, the image `kirin.png`
on its front face (we assume this has been previously imported), and the tags _Japanese_ and _Kanji_. +
Effectively, this changes the first card into a completely different card. +
Note that the back face need not be English.

=== How do I import an image?

See <<AddCardImage>>.

=== How do I insert an image to a flashcard?

To insert an image to an existing flashcard, use the `edit` command
and specify the `IMAGE_NAME`.

[NOTE]
**Note:** You will need to _import_ the image into _Acquizition_ first. See <<AddCardImage>>
for an explanation of how this can be done.

=== How do I remove an image from a flashcard?

To remove an image from a flashcard, use the `edit` command and specify an empty `IMAGE_NAME`.

Specifically, type `edit INDEX b/` into the command box and press kbd:[Enter].

=== How do I insert tags to a flashcard?

To insert tags into a flashcard, use the `edit` command and specify _all_ the
existing tags, followed by the tags you want to insert.

[NOTE]
**Note:** For more information about the `edit` command, see <<EditCard>>.

=== How do I remove tags from a flashcard?

To remove _all_ the tags from a flashcard, use the `edit` command and
specify an empty `TAG`.

Specifically, type `edit INDEX t/` into the command box and press kbd:[Enter].

To remove _only some_ of the tags from a flashcard, use the `edit` command and
specify the tags you want _to remain_.

[NOTE]
**Note:** For more information about the `edit` command, see <<EditCard>>.

=== How do I restore all the flashcards to the currently-visible list?

When using the `find` command, the currently-visible list of flashcards will
change to show you the results. This will also affect the indices you should use
when referring to the flashcards using the `edit` and `delete` commands.

To restore the list of all flashcards, simply use the `list` command.

Type `list` and press kbd:[Enter].

[[UndoCommand]]
=== How do I undo the most recent command?

You can undo a command by using the `undo` command.

Type `undo` and press kbd:[Enter].

[NOTE]
**Note:** Not all commands can be undone. Only the following commands can be
undone: `add`, `clear`, `delete`, `edit`, `import`, `quiz`. +
Undo will cause the most recent _undoable_ command to be undone.

Examples:

* {blank}
. `delete 1` +
This deletes the first flashcard.
. `list` +
This lists all the flashcards.
. `undo` +
This will undo the most recent undoable command, which is `delete 1`. So, this will
restore the deleted flashcard back as the first flashcard.
* {blank}
. `delete 2` +
This deletes the second flashcard.
. `delete 1` +
This deletes the first flashcard.
. `undo` +
This will undo the most recent undoable command, which is `delete 1`. So, this will
restore the deleted flashcard back as the first flashcard.
. `undo` +
This will undo the most recent undoable command, which is `delete 2`. So, this will
restore the deleted flashcard back as the second flashcard.

=== How do I redo the most recent undone command?

You can redo an undone command by using the `redo` command. +

Type `redo` and press kbd:[Enter].

[NOTE]
**Note:** The `redo` command only works if no new undoable command was made in between
the time the the last `undo` command was made and the `redo` command is called.

Examples:

* {blank}
. `delete 1` +
This deletes the first flashcard.
. `undo` +
This will undo the most recent undoable command, which is `delete 1`. So, this will
restore the deleted flashcard back as the first flashcard.
. `redo` +
This will redo the command the undo undid, which is `delete 1`. So, this will
delete the first flashcard again.
* {blank}
. `delete 2` +
This deletes the second flashcard.
. `delete 1` +
This deletes the first flashcard.
. `undo` +
This will undo the most recent undoable command, which is `delete 1`. So, this will
restore the deleted flashcard back as the first flashcard.
. `undo` +
This will undo the most recent undoable command, which is `delete 2`. So, this will
restore the deleted flashcard back as the second flashcard.
. `redo` +
This will redo the command the undo undid, which is `delete 2`. So, this will
delete the second flashcard again.
. `redo` +
This will redo the command the undo undid, which is `delete 1`. So, this will
delete the first flashcard again.

=== How do I discard the results of the most recent quiz session?

The quiz command updates the statistics of the flashcards, and you may want to
void the results of the most recent quiz session and undo the updates to the cards'
statistics.

You can discard the results of the most recent quiz session by using the `undo`
command right after a quiz session.

[NOTE]
**Note:** For more information about the `undo` command, see <<UndoCommand>>.

=== How do I see the list of commands I have made?

You can see the list of previous commands by using the `history` command. +

Type `history` and press kbd:[Enter].

[TIP]
====
**Tip:** Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

=== How do I exit _Acquizition_?

All good things must come to an end!

To exit _Acquizition_, use the `exit` command.

Type `exit` and press kbd:[Enter].

[NOTE]
**Note:** If you are in quiz mode, `exit` will exit quiz mode instead. +
To exit _Acquizition_, use the `exit` command twice: once to exit quiz mode,

=== What if I want to know how good I am in the quiz mode?

You can know your success rate in quiz mode by using `stats` command.

Type `stats [f/FRONT_TEXT]... [b/BACK_TEXT]... [t/TAG]​...​` into the command box and
press kbd:[Enter].

This command will display your success rate on a filtered list based on the front text, back text and tags.
If you don't specify anything, your success rate over the flashcards in your current filtered flashcards list is displayed instead.

[NOTE]
**Note:** You can use `find` followed by `stats` to show aggregate statistics for all the flashcards found
          and listed by the find command.

Examples:

* `stats t/Chinese t/Japanese` +
This will show aggregate statistics for all flashcards that have the _Chinese_ or _Japanese_ tag.
* `find f/Kamusta` +
`stats` +
This will find and list all flashcards with _Kamusta_ in their front face then show aggregate
statistics for all those flashcards.
// end::stats[]

// tag::select[]
=== What if I want to know how good I am for a particular card?

You can know your success rate for a particular card by using `select` command.

Type `select INDEX` into the command box and
press kbd:[Enter].

This command will select a flashcard and display it on the flashcard view on the right pane.
You can see the statistics of the selected flashcard on the command result box.

image::Select-Ui.png[width="790"]

// end::select[]

// tag::srs[]
=== I memorized some flashcards better than the other, how can I address this?

You can use our learning recommendation system. The system is called Spaced Repetition System or in short SRS. This system will schedule each flashcard a particular time to review. Additionally, based on your performance, SRS will adjust the frequency of the flashcards so that the "more hard to memorize" card will be shown more often.

Type `quiz srs` into the command box and
press kbd:[Enter].

This command will trigger the SRS mode in the quiz instead of the normal quiz mode. You can refer to the <<Features (Quiz)>> for more info about vanilla quiz mode.

After you finished a quiz session, our app will update your proficiency in each flashcard and schedule the next time you can review the card in SRS.
// end::srs[]


=== What if I want to bring up this document again?

You can bring up this document again using the `help` command.

Type `help` and press kbd:[Enter].

=== Finding flashcards by keyword(s): `find`

Finds and lists all the flashcards whose front text, back text or collection tags
contain _any_ of the given keywords. +

Format: ​`find [f/FRONT_FACE]... [b/BACK_FACE]... [t/TAG]...`

****
* You must specify at least _one_ keyword.
* Multiple keywords can be specified for the front text, back text and tags by
specifying multiple prefixes. For example, `find f/Kamusta f/Terima kasih` finds
and lists _all_ the flashcards whose front face contains the word _Kamusta_ or _Terima_ or _kasih_. +
Keywords are not case sensitive: `f/Kamusta` will match `kamusta`, `kAmUsTa` or `KAMUSTA`.
** Multiple tags must specifically be specified with multiple prefixes. `t/Tagalog Japanese` is forbidden;
use `t/Tagalog t/Japanese` instead.
****

Examples:

* `find t/Chinese t/Japanese` +
This will find and list all the flashcards that have the _Chinese_ or _Japanese_ tag.
* `find f/Hello b/Hello` +
This will find and list all the flashcards whose front or back text contains the word _Hello_.

// tag::share[]
=== Exporting flashcards to a text file : `share`
Creates a text file containing a collection of flashcards to be shared.

Format: `share DIRECTORY_PATH`

****
* This creates a text file called _flashcards.txt_ at the specified location.
* The text file created by the share command will be saved locally in the main application directory; you should share
 this text file with your friends.
* Once your friend has a copy of the text file, he can import the flashcards using the `import` command
* **Images will not be shared.**
****

Examples:

* `find t/Chinese` +
`share C:\Users\Alice\Desktop` +
This will create a text file called _flashcards.txt_ at the specified location containing all the flashcards that
have the _Chinese_ tag.

* In the illustrated example below, one of the cards in the text file already existed locally. So only 6 out of
the 7 flashcards in the file successfully imported.

image::Ui-preImport.png[width="790"]
image::Ui-postImport.png[width="790"]
// end::share[]

// tag::import[]
=== Importing flashcards from a text file : `import`
Adds flashcards to your collection from a text file.

Format: `import FILE_PATH`

****
* This imports all the flashcards from a text file (produced by `share`) to your collection.
** This does not replace your flashcard collection; it simply adds all the flashcards from the text file
one-by-one.
** This command will also report the number of flashcards successfully imported.
****

Examples:

* `import C:\Users\Luca\Desktop\cards.txt` +
This will import the flashcards from `cards.txt` to your collection.
// end::import[]

// tag::quiz[]
[[FeaturesQuiz]]
== Features (Quiz)

=== Entering quiz mode : `quiz`

image::Ui-quiz.png[width="790"]

Enters quiz mode. +
The quiz mode will use the cards from the filtered card collection list +
A flashcard will be shown to you one by one randomly based on accuracy of each flashcard. +
You can then self-verify using `good` and `bad` commands whether you accurately recall the back side of the flashcard.

Format: `quiz`

****
* Enters quiz mode with the flashcards on the filtered flashcard list panel.
* This will start a quiz session. The flashcard list panel on the left will change to a quiz panel.
* The quiz panel contains the number of flashcards remaining on the quiz, as well as the number of good and bad feedback received.
* The flashcard view panel on the right will display the quizzed flashcards one by one, with the back face of the flashcard hidden.
****

Example:

* `find t/chinese` +
`quiz` +
This will start a quiz mode with all flashcards with the chinese tag.

=== Showing back face of flashcard : `show`

Shows the back face of the flashcard being quizzed.

Format: `show`

****
* If the back face of the flashcard is already shown, this command will do nothing.
* Note that you can only use this command inside quiz mode.
****

=== Giving feedback : `good` or `bad`

Gives user feedback on quiz mode.

Format: `good` or `bad`

****
* In order to give feedback of how well you do in the quiz mode, you can type in either `good` or `bad` for each flashcard in the quiz.
* After you type `good` or `bad`, Acquizition will record the feedback on the flashcard shown, as well as incrementing the number of good and bad feedback.
* Acquizition will then proceed to show the next flashcard to be quizzed. If there are no flashcards left, it will exit quiz mode.
* This command is usually, but not necessarily, used after the `show` command. That is, after you look at the back face of the flashcard, you can dictate how well you recall the back face of the flashcard.
* Note that you can only use this command inside quiz mode.
****

Examples:

* `quiz` +
`good` +
This will increment the number of good feedback of the flashcard shown, thus, the success rate of this flashcard will increase. +
Then, the next flashcard in the quiz queue will be shown.
* `quiz` +
`show` +
`bad` +
This will increment the number of bad feedback of the flashcard shown, thus, the success rate of this flashcard will decrease. +
Then, the next flashcard in the quiz queue will be shown.
* `quiz` +
`good` +
`...` +
`good` +
Suppose this is the last flashcard to show inside quiz mode. Acquizition will record the statistics of the quiz mode and exit the quiz mode.

=== Smart command : kbd:[Enter]

It can be troublesome to always have to type `show` and `good`. +
You can use a _smart command_ that cleverly chooses the appropriate command to run.

Format: kbd:[Enter]

****
* To initiate a smart command, you just need to press enter.
* If you are in quiz mode, and the back face of the quizzed flashcard is not yet shown, smart command will execute a `show` command.
* If you are in quiz mode, and the back face of the quizzed flashcard has been shown, smart command will execute a `good` command.
* This dramatically reduces your time to navigate through the quiz!
****

Examples:

* `quiz` +
kbd:[Enter] +
kbd:[Enter] +
This will first show the back face of the flashcard, then will mark the flashcard as good.
* `quiz` +
kbd:[Enter] +
`bad` +
This will show the back face of the flashcard, then will mark the flashcard as bad.
* `quiz` +
kbd:[Enter] +
`...` +
kbd:[Enter] +
This will go through all the flashcards in the quiz mode and mark them all as good.

[[QuizExit]]
=== Exiting quiz mode : `exit`
Exits quiz mode prematurely if you are in quiz mode. +

Format: `exit`
// end::quiz[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I save my data? +
*A*: Your data is saved automatically after each command; there is no need to
explicitly save.

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file
it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Acquizition
folder.
