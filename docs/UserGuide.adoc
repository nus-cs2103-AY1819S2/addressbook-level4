== Introduction

*The Real App* is an enhanced Address Book designed primarily for *real estate agents* who need to store large number of client contacts as well as property information.
You can *store* contact details for each of your specialised named clients, as well as essential information for the associated property.
You can *search* for contact information using keywords.
You can *pin* important contacts and even *archive* them when you no longer need them.
*Select* your contact to display the location of the associated property on Google Maps(TM), so you know exactly where it is!

With these and many other features, The Real App is optimized for those who prefer to use a *desktop app* for managing contacts, and *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, The Real App can help you manage all your contact and property information quickly and securely.

Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

*Setting up the app*

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `therealapp.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for The Real App.

[TIP]
New files and folders will be generated after launching the app. +
You are recommended to move the jar file into a new empty folder.

// tag::explainui[]
*Starting the app*

.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
E.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  The outcome of the command will be displayed in the result display box. +
E.g. after successfully executing the `help` command, the following message will appear: +
 _Opened help window._ +
 _Displaying main person list!_
 .  The pin list shows the contacts who has been pinned. It can be resized by clicking and dragging the borders of the box.
 .  The main contact list shows the active list of contacts. It can also be resized by clicking and dragging the borders of the box. You can toggle between the contact list view and the archive list view using commands `list` and `archivelist`.
 .  The browser window will display the property's location on Google Maps(TM) when an appropriate contact is selected. You can go to <<GoogleMaps>> for more details of the Google Maps(TM) display.

// end::explainui[]
