/**
 * Represents a File name (without the file extension) in MediTabs.
 * Standardise the File Naming Convention in MediTabs and also to ensure the file name
 * specified (without the file extension) is valid. It does not check whether
 * the file name is too long (Windows has an issue with long file names and it also involves file systems:
 * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file#short-vs-long-names" target="_blank">
 *     Link</a>
 * <p>
 * We suggest complementing this class with Java build in class such as
 * {@link java.io.File File} or {@link java.nio.file.Files Files} and handling
 * the exceptions thrown by the methods used in those classes when creating files with the file name validated to
 * resolve potential exceptions involving permissions, security, file name being too long, etc.
 * </p>
 * Note: In an effort to make it platform independent, the validation is such that it ensures that the specified
 * file name does not violate file naming conventions in any platform especially Windows which has a very strict
 * file name conventions:
 * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file#naming-conventions" target="_blank">
 *     Link</a>
 * <p>
 * Guarantees: immutable; is valid as declared in {@link #isValidFileName(String)}
