== What Is This?

RestOrRant is a simple restaurant management application intended to increase the efficiency of front-end operations in restaurants.
Our application is targeted at restaurants that are still using traditional methods, such as pen and paper, to run their front-end operations.
This serves as a simple and affordable alternative for restaurants who do not require the comprehensive
set of end-to-end features provided by other restaurant management systems in the market.

This is a desktop application that has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but most of the user interactions happen using a Command Line Interface (CLI).
Hence, our target users are restaurant managers, waiters and cashiers who can type fast and prefer typing over clicking on GUI.

== What Can It Do?

It can...

* Display the current status of the restaurant at any time.
* Manage the use of tables in the restaurant.
* Track orders for individual tables and across all tables.
* Calculate the bill for each order.
* Update the availability of items on the restaurant's menu.
* Consolidate revenue and order statistics of the restaurant.
