== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [skill/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe skill/friend
position/Systems Analyst` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[skill/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `skill/Java`, `skill/Excel skill/leadership` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

// end::add[]


=== Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all candidates in Recruit Me. If there is a filtering available, it lists all the persons that passes all the filtering conditions. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing candidate in Recruit Me. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [d/EDUCATION] [g/GPA] [deg/DEGREE-LEVEL] [a/ADDRESS] [skill/TAG]... [position/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed (i.e adding of tags is not cumulative, both skills and positions will be changed after editing one of them) except for
existing endorsement tags.

* You can remove all the person's tags, except for endorsement tags, by typing `skill/` or 'position/' without
specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower skill/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags except for endorsements.


// tag::filter[]
=== Filtering Recruit Me: `filter`

* It filters the current applicant pool regarding the existing entities of every single person (name, phone, email, address, gpa, education (school), degree level, position, endorsement count or skills). +
* *Format:* `filter or/and [name<NAME>name] [phone<PHONE>phone] [email<EMAIL>email] [gpa<GPA>gpa] [edu<EDUCATION>edu] [deg<DEGREE-LEVEL>deg] [addr<ADDRESS>addr] [skill<SKILL1, SKILL2, ... >skill][pos<POSITION1, POSITION2, ... >pos] [end<ENDORSEMENT>end]`

[TIP]
For every field, using `< or >` can cause false results. Please do not use them in filtering criterion texts. All the fields are optional but at least one field should be used.

****

*Definition of Some Keywords for the Filter Guide:*

* *Prefix:* basically the beginning part of every field in the command e.g. `name<` for NAME field, `deg<` for DEGREE-LEVEL.
* *Reverse Prefix:* the ending part of every field in the command e.g. `>name` for NAME field, `>deg` for DEGREE-LEVEL.
* *Condition:* The text between every `Prefix` and `Reverse Prefix` couple.

*Different Types of Filtering Processes:*

* `OR` Usage: According to the conditions written, if at least one of them passes with the regarding person in the applicant pool, the person is included in the filtered version.
* `AND` Usage: According to the conditions written, if every single one of them passes with the regarding person in the applicant pool, the person is included in the filtered version.

*Special Input Conditions for Fields:*

* For all the non-mentioned fields below, the default input format should be applied for the filtering field. Default input formats can be checked from `Adding a person: add - User Guide`
* For `PHONE`, any number of integers more than 0 can be entered.
* For `EMAIL` and `ADDRESS`, any number of ASCII characters (also take the `TIP` into attention for correct results) more than 0 can be used.
* For `GPA`, it prints the persons who have higher or equal amount of GPA from the given input
* For `ENDORSEMENT`, a positive integer value is wanted, it prints the persons who have that much or higher amount of endorsements.
* For `SKILLS` and `POSITIONS`, if more than one specification are added to the filter, they should be separated by ','
* For `DEGREE-LEVEL`, there are 2 input type options: text and number. For the text format, the search is *case-insensitive*. So, any uppercase or lowercase type of the text is accepted.
If filtering is applied for this criteria, the persons with the same or higher education levels are shown. There 5 different levels for the input:
** *Number:* `0` and *Text:* `highschool` / *Number:* `1` and *Text:* `associates` (2-year-university) / *Number:* `2` and *Text:* `bachelors` / *Number:* `3` and *Text:* `masters` / *Number:* `4` and *Text:* `phd`

*About the Running Process of Filtering Command:*

* The filtering is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* Filtering does not check if the written condition passes totally. It only checks, if the written condition is contained in the person properties.
e.g if there is someone named Alex, in the filtering conditions `n/ale/n` or `n/le/n` or `n/lex/n`, Alex will be included.
* All the people that are included in the filtering will be returned.
* `ADD` operation clears the existing filters automatically.
* After one filtering, the filtered address book can be filtered again.
* For every single criteria between the filtering prefixes, input check for the validity is made.
* When filtering is active, adding a person also clears the filter along the addition. But addition takes place.

****

Examples:

* `filter or phone<91234567>phone email<mail@ex>email skill<C++, Java>skill end<2>end deg<4>deg`
** _Returns the people, whose numbers include `91234567` or whose email includes `mail@ex` or who has (contains) at least `C++ or Java` in the skills or has at least `2 endorsements` or has at least `Master's degree`._
* `filter and name<ale>name addr<street>addr gpa<3.1>gpa pos<Manager, Developer>pos deg<bachelors>deg`
** _Returns the people, whose name contains `ale` (in any uppercase and lowercase format) and whose address contains `street` and who is interested in `Manager and Developer` positions,has a GPA higher than or equal to `3.1` and has at least `Bachelor's degree`._

=== Clearing the filter in Recruit Me: `filter clear`

Format: `filter reverse`
// end::filter[]


=== Employee approval of candidates: `endorse`

Endorses an existing candidate in RecruitMe. +
Format: `endorse [clear] INDEX n/YOUR NAME`

* Feature for employees to navigate the recruiting platform and choose candidates that they want hired
****
* Endorses the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* All ASCII characters accepted, not limited to alphanumeric characters
* Error will be thrown if an employee tries to endorse a candidate more than once
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed (i.e adding of tags is not cumulative) except for
existing endorsement tags.
* Optional *clear* keyword will delete the employee endorsement at a specified index

* Compatible with filter and sorting methods for easy navigatio

****

Examples:

* `endorse 1 n/Steve Jobs`
Adds a blue tag to the candidate at the `1` index with the text `Steve Jobs`
* `endorse clear 1 n/Steve Jobs`
Removes 'Steve Jobs' blue tag from the candidate at the `1` index


=== Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* It filters the list of candidates temporally. If you use `filter` or `sort` commands after that, they uses the entire list to process. To have a permanent filtering until you use `add` command or clear the filter, use the `filter` command.
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Intelligent Sorting:

It is possible for persons to share the same information _(e.g. both have the same GPA)_.
For this situation a subsequent sorting method to sort these persons is chosen based on what the user, wanting a certain initial sort method, is likely to be interested in.

Since persons in the address book cannot have the same full name, this shall always differentiate persons and so is used as the final sorting method.

****
* The `sort` command is compatible with the `filter` command. +
If the Address Book contains ten persons, but the filter has selected just three persons, then only the three persons shall be ordered and returned with the new index numbers. +
Additional filters can be applied within the sort.
* The `sort` command is partially compatible with the `find` command. +
If the Address Book is currently sorted according to a certain method, the `find` command shall return the persons, according to the specified find keyword, ordered by the previous sort method. +
If the Address Book has currently _found_ certain persons from the `find` command, a subsequent sort shall sort all those in the address book and not just those that have been _found_.
Should the user wish to just sort a few people, the `filter` command should be used as outlined above.
* The `sort` command is compatible with all other commands (add/clear/delete/edit/exit/help/history/list/redo/select/undo). +
It shall not automatically update the returned list of persons. For example adding a person shall simply add them to the end of the list of persons.
****

=== Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed applicant pool.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd person in the applicant pool.
* `find Betsy` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

=== Selecting a person : `select`

Selects the person identified by the index number used in the displayed applicant pool. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****

* Selects the person and loads the CV the person at the specified `INDEX` if there is a CV for that person in the storage. If there is not, a placeholder page is loaded that says no CV is available.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`

****

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` +
`select 1` +
Selects the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +

=== Showing and Updating the `CV` for a Person:

*Showing Stage:*

* Just running the `select` command or clicking on the wanted person opens the CV.
* If there is no CV is available for the person, it shows a placeholder page.

*Adding a new CV:*

* After running the application first time and selecting someone in the application, the directories `./data/html` and `./data/html/cv` should be created.
* To add a new CV to the application, please create an `HTML` file in `./data/html` directory.
** The name of the directory should be the name of the person in lowercase with no-space-separated format (e.g. if the candidate name is Alex Yeoh, the file name should be `alexyeoh.html`).
** The content of the HTML is below. to the field in HTML content `[YOUR_JPG_FILE_CV]` place the name that you gave to HTML file. But do not add any extension.
** Prepare the CV you want to add in `JPG` format and name with the text that you wrote to `[YOUR_JPG_FILE_CV]` and place this file to directory `./data/html/cv`
....
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="DarkTheme.css">
</head>
<body style="background-color:#383838">
	<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:40%"
	src="./cv/[YOUR_JPG_FILE_CV].jpg">
</body>
</html>

....

*Updating a CV:*

* `Edit Command:` If you change name of a candidate in the application, the name of the HTML file is not automatically updated. Please update the name.
** If you change name of a person that came to the application by default and has a CV, you cannot reach to that person's CV until you reverse your edit.
* `Delete Command:` If you delete one person from the application, the HTML and JPG files are not automatically deleted. Please delete them manually if you want those files to be deleted.

*What comes in v2.0?*

* Automatic file handling for editing and deleting commands.
* For addition, path of a JPG image will be taken and the html file will be constructed and JPG file will be copied to the right directory directly by the application.
* Currently, adding multiple CVs at one is not available, thet will be possible with v2.0.

// end::cvview[]

=== Saving the data

Applicant data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

// tag::addmultiplepersons[]
=== Adding Multiple Persons `[coming in v2.0]`

* Right now, through the application there is no possibility to add multiple persons at once. This feature will come with v2.0.
* However, there is a way to add multiple persons at once:
** If you run the application at least once and change some data in it, you will see the directory `./data/addressbook.json`.
** It is the `JSON` file that holds every single person on the application. The format is given below.
** As long as the format is correct, you can add as many people as you want or if you have a ready file with the same format, you can replace it directly as long as you rename the file as `addressbook.json`.
** The changes made in the file will be shown in the application GUI itself, too.
