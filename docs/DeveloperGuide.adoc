By: `Team W14-3`      Since: `Jan 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.


// tag::battle[]

[[Design-Battle]]
=== Battle component

.Structure of the Battle Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/battle/Battle.java[`Battle.java`]

The `Battle` component,

* keeps track of the progress of the battle,
* restricts the computer to place its ships at the correct time,
* allows the user and the computer enemy to attack each other and maintain proper turn-taking while doing so.

// end::battle[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::map[]
=== Map Feature
==== Current Implementation
The map feature is facilitated by `MapGrid` and `Cell`.
The map grid is stored internally in `MapGrid` as a 2D array of `Cell` objects.
`MapGrid` implements the following method to initialise the map.

* `MapGrid#initialise(Cell[][] map)` -- initialises the map using the given `Cell` 2D array.

Below is the code snippet for the `initialise` method
[source,java]
----
include::../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/MapGrid.java[lines=64..71]
----
`cellGrid` is the internal 2D array comprising of `Cell` objects. +
The method `copy2dArray` copies the `map` parameter passed in to the internal `cellGrid`

Below is the code snippet for the `copy2dArray` method.
[source,java]
----
include::../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/MapGrid.java[lines=118..124]
----

The `copy2dArray` method creates a new `Cell` object for each of the input `Cell` objects.
The copying is done using a constructor in `Cell` that takes in a parameter `Cell`.
This constructor copies the private attributes of the given `Cell` parameter.

{empty} +
The following sequence diagram shows how a map is initialised:

image::InitialiseMapCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

{empty} +

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How initialise map works
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `MapGrid` will have an initialise method that takes in a 2D array of `Cell` objects.
The initialise method in `MapGrid` will then do a deep copy of the passed in 2D array to initialise the internal 2D array of `Cell`.

** Pros: The underlying 2D array in `MapGrid` is better protected from modification as it can only be modified through the initialise method.
** Cons: Might have more overhead due to deep copying.

* **Alternative 2:** `MapGrid` will have a getter method that returns the 2D array of `Cell`.
`InitialiseMapCommand` will then use this method to get the internal 2D array and populate it from outside of the `MapGrid` class.

** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: The 2D array within `MapGrid` is unprotected and open for modification.

Alternative 1 was chosen as the overhead is negligible and a defensive approach to the design is preferable.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the map
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** 2D array of `Cell` objects.
** Pros: Resulting code is simple and readable.
** Cons: More changes to be done from the original AB4 codebase.

* **Alternative 2:** List of lists of `Cell` objects.
** Pros: Easier to implement from the original AB4 codebase.
** Cons: Bad code readability and more complicated.

Alternative 1 was chosen because of good code readability and it being the simpler implementation.
Good code readability is important for new developers taking on the project.
Simpler implementation means the likelihood of bugs being introduced is less when changes are made.

// end::map[]

{empty} +

=== Battleship Feature
==== Current Implementation
A battleship is a basic class representing a battleship that can be placed on the map grid. The length of the battleship varies, depending on the type of battleship. There are three types of battleships: +

1. Cruiser of length 2.
1. Destroyer of length 3.
1. Aircraft carrier of length 5.

The number of battleship types that a user can deploy on the map depends on the size of the map. It is given by the formula:

1. Number of cruisers = `mapSize - 5`
1. Number of destroyers = `(mapSize + 2) / 5`.
1. Number of aircraft carriers = `1`.

The user can tag a battleship using a `t/[TAG]` parameter in the `put` command. Tagging battleships is optional.

[NOTE]
The head of a battleship refers to the top-most and left-most cell of the battleship. When coordinates are specified in the `put` command, it specifies the coordinates of the head of the battleship, as shown in the figure below.

image:BattleshipHeadExample.png[width=800]

.The coordinates of the `put` command refer to the coordinates of the battleship head.
image:BattleshipHeadExample2.png[width=800]

The following operations are called when the `put` command is called.

* `performChecks()` - performs boundary checks on the map grid to ensure that the battleship can be placed on the map.
* `putShip()` - puts the battleship into the cell.
* `getCell()` - gets the cell that is specified by the coordinates provided by the user.

Here is an example of a given user scenario.

Step 1. Initialise the map to a map of size 10.

image:PutShipWalkThrough1.png[width=800]

Step 2. Put the battleship on the map by specifying the name, coordinates, orientation, and tags.

image:PutShipWalkThrough2.png[width=800]

The following sequence diagram shows how a battleship is put on the map.

.Sequence diagram of putting a battleship on the map.
image::PutShipSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

Battleships can be tagged. You can list all the tags used by battleships that have been deployed on the map grid using the `listTags` command. The sequence diagram below shows how the tags are listed.

.Sequence diagram of listing battleship tags.
image::ListTagsSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

Battleships that have been deployed can also be listed. Battleships can be listed in four different ways:

1. List all battleships.
1. List battleships that have certain tags.
1. List battleships of a certain type.
1. List battleships of a certain type that have certain tags.

Here is an example of a given user scenario. In this scenario, the user has deployed some battleships on a 10 by 10 map grid with various tags.

Step 1. Initialise the map to a map of size 10.
Step 2. Deploy battleships by specifying the name, coordinates, orientation, and tags. We will deploy the following battleships:

* Cruiser at a4 vertical with tag `tag1`.
* Cruiser at d4 vertical with tag `tag1`.
* Cruiser at f7 horizontal with tag `tag2`.
* Cruiser at h8 horizontal with tag `tag2`.
* Destroyer at d4 horizontal with tag `tag1`.

Step 3. List the battleships.

image::ListExample1.png[width=800]

Step 4. List the battleships by name. Use `cruiser`.

image::ListExample2.png[width=800]

Step 5. List the battleships by name and tags. Use `cruiser` with `tag2`.

image::ListExample3.png[width=800]


The following sequence diagram shows how deployed battleships are listed when the `list` command is entered into the command line.

.Sequence diagram of listing battleships deployed on the map.
image::ListShipSequenceDiagram.png[width=1499][height=2249]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How a battleship is placed on the map
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** +
 The same `Battleship` object is put in multiple cells. Each cell contains a reference to the same `Battleship` object. When a battleship on the `Cell` needs to be modified, the `Battleship` attribute in the `Cell` is accessed.
** Pros: This allows any cell that is hit to access the same `Battleship` object without having to separately find the `Battleship` object.
** Cons: Difficult to keep track of each `Battleship` position.
* **Alternative 2:** +
Have two separate `Battleship` and `BattleshipPart` objects. The `BattleshipPart` object represents the "body" of the `Battleship` and contains an attribute that points to the `Battleship`. When a battleship on the `Cell` needs to be modified, the `BattleshipPart` is accessed, which then accesses the main `Battleship` object.
** Pros: Clearer separation between the "body" of the Battleship and the Battleship itself.
** Cons: Difficult to handle hit on the cell.

===== Aspect: Data structure to record battleships in player
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** +
`ArrayList` of `FleetEntry`, where `FleetEntry` contains a reference to the `Battleship`, its `Orientation` and `Coordinates` of the head. The `FleetEntry` subclass exists in `Fleet`. Whenever a `Fleet` method is called, it accesses the `ArrayList` of `FleetEntry` to obtain information about the `Battleship` and its position on the `MapGrid`.
** Pros: Can identify `Battleship` by position.
** Cons: Harder to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** `ArrayList` of `Battleship`.
** Pros: Easier to implement and provides a cleaner design.
** Cons: Harder check position of `Battleship` on the map grid. In order to do so, a separate data structure has to be initialised to store the coordinates and orientation of the battleship. This data structure then has to be aligned with the original `ArrayList` that stores the battleship.

// tag::battle[]
=== Battle Feature
==== Current Implementation
The Battle feature handles the following:

* keeping track of the stage of the battle, and ensuring that the player does not
  enter a command in the wrong stage of the game,
* allowing the computer to place its ships at the correct time,
* allowing the user and the computer enemy to attack each other and maintain proper turn-taking while doing so.

The Battle feature is split between several packages:

  * `seedu.address.battle`: the main `Battle` class is implemented here
  * `seedu.address.battle.state`: the battle state classes are implemented here, and
    can be stored and retrieved via `Model`.
  * `seedu.address.battle.result`: the attack result classes are implemented here.
    These classes are returned by `Battle#humanPerformAttack(coordinates)` and
    `Battle#takeComputerTurn()`.
  * `BeginCommand`, `AttackCommand` and `EndTurnCommand` handle the player's interaction
    with this component.

The sequence diagram of what happens when the user enters the `begin` command is as follows:


.Sequence diagram of beginning the battle.
image::BeginSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** +
  `BattleManager` is stored under `Model`. Every time `Attack`, `EndTurn` or `Begin` commands
  are executed, they will use this `BattleManager` to actually perform the actions,
  with the logic in the `Command`-s mostly being error handling. +
  When AI performs attacks, the `BattleManager` will call the AI to compute its attack
  and return it, then call an internal method to actually perform the attack.
** Pros:
*** Command logic is abstracted into places where it can be reused by the AI.
** Cons:
*** The `Model` component now contains game logic (`BattleManager`) within it.
* **Alternative 2:** +
  `BattleManager` is stored under `Logic`. Every time `Attack`, `EndTurn` or `Begin` commands
  are executed, they will perform the action using the logic coded within themselves, not
  interfacing with `BattleManager`. +
  When AI performs attacks, the `BattleManager` will create these commands and execute them.
  In the `Model`, the current attacking player is kept track of, allowing the commands to be
  used for both a human and AI player.
** Pros:
*** The game's model and logic are kept separate from each other.
** Cons:
*** AttackCommand is now state-dependent (the state being the current attacking player) which
    can more easily lead to bugs and race conditions.


// end::battle[]

=== Enemy AI Feature
==== Current Implementation
The Enemy AI feature is currently implemented as an extension of the Player class,
and serves as the opponent player since `Battleship` is a single-player game.
The Enemy AI can automatically perform initialising actions similar to the human player.
Mainly, the Enemy AI can randomly initialise its own mapGrid with randomly generated ships,
which is invoked by the command `start game`.
The Enemy AI also supports the ability for the enemy to intelligently shoot
the player's map when the player inputs the `end turn` command.

Note that the Enemy AI feature does not contain any explicit commands to be
entered by the Player. Its methods are called by other features instead, and does its
magic in the background.

*Initialising Enemy MapGrid*

The Enemy AI has the method `populateMapGrid` which is called by the method `prepEnemy()`,
which is in turn called by the Battle Manager when the Player enters the command `start game`.

`populateMapGrid()` will generate randomised battleships based on the number of battleships
available to it for the current game, as specified in its Parent class - Player.
The number of battleships available to the Enemy AI is congruent to the number of battleships
available to the Player. The exact number of the different types of battleships is decided from on
a formula that is based on the map size specified by the player in the `init` command. Once these randomised
battleships are generated, `populateMapGrid` will proceed to call `placeAirCraftCarrier()` and `placeMultipleDestroyerAndCruiser()`.

*Calculating Cell to Attack*

The Enemy AI has the method `enemyShootAt()` that is invoked when the player ends their turn
with the command `end turn`. The Enemy AI will attempt to generate a random Coordinate to attack,
and pass this Coordinate to the `BattleManager`. The Enemy AI supports the ability to
check that its generated coordinates are all valid, and has further algorithm that will
increase its accuracy upon detecting a successful hit.

image::enemyShoot.gif[width=500]

__Note: All actions taken by the Enemy AI are seeded by a pseudo-random generator.
Thus, its behaviour will be different for every game session.__


==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** seed all methods with pseudo-random seed
** Pros: each game will be a different experience
** Cons: testing will be more difficult
* **Alternative 2:** pre-calculate and hardcode the actions the Enemy AI performs
** Pros: testing is made very much easier
** Cons: games would be less dynamic since the enemy's behaviour is non-organic

// tag::stats[]
=== Statistics Feature
==== Current Implementation
The `stats` feature allows users to view their current gameplay information. This information will be displayed in a pop-up window and will include: Number of Attacks Made, Number of Successful Hits, Number of Misses, Number of Enemy Ships Destroyed and Accuracy of Shots made.
This feature stems from a central abstract class that is extended to for a player. It is initialized with the main components upon the start of the application and is subsequently passed down as a parameter to the relevant methods which will invoke the corresponding updating methods to the statistical information.

The following operations are invoked upon the calling of the `stats` command.

** `getAttacksMade()` - Returns the number of attacks made by the User
** `getMovesLeft()` - Returns the remaining number of moves left for the User
** `getHitCount()` - Returns the number of successful hit on enemy ships
** `getMissCount()` Returns the number of misses made
** `getEnemyShipsDestroyed()` Returns the number of Enemy Ships Destroyed by the player
** `getAccuracy()` Returns the current Hit-Miss Ratio of the User based on the game so far

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `stats` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The User initializes the game with the `init 8` which will create a 8x8 map.

! The Map can be initialized to any valid size (This is just a sample scenario)

Step 2. Put the ships accordingly...

Step 3. Input `stats` into the command-line and press enter to obtain the current statistical data.

image::inputStatsCommandSS.png[width=250]
! Note, there should not be any valid data at the moment as the game as not started.
! Include Screenshot explaining pop-up window and lack of data

image::StatsWindowSS.png[width=600]
Step 4. Now proceed with the game and perform an attack ....

Step 5. Invoke the `stats` command again to view the updated statistics

image::StatsWindowUpdatedSS.PNG[width=400]

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a User invokes the `stats` command.

image::StatsSequenceDiagram.PNG[width=800]

==== Output Statistical Data
Besides the pop-up window, the data is also captured in the command-line result box.

image::StatsCommandBox.PNG[width=400]

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Statistics class will have an initialise method that with a set of default configuration that are used by any Statistics Variant.
** Pros: The underlying variables and values in Statistics is better protected from modification.
** Cons: It does not accommodate changes in default settings.
* **Alternative 2:** Statistics is stored entirely within StatsCommands
** Pros: Easy to code and less lines of code.
** Cons: Does not abide by Single Responsibility Principle as the `StatsCommand` will also contain filtering and analysis of data.
// tag::stats[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Instructions for Manual Testing (!!Must change to fit our context!!)

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Initialising the maps
. Initialising the maps after launching the game

.. Test case: `init 7` +
   Expected: Displays two empty map grids of size 7 in the GUI. Both maps will have the appropriate alphanumeric labels on the first row and column.
.. Test case: `init 0` +
   Expected: If this is the first command ran, no map will be displayed. Otherwise, no changes will be made to the displayed maps.
   Error message will be displayed in the result display box.
.. Other incorrect initialise commands to try: `init`, `init x` (where x is smaller or larger than the specified minimum or maximum map size respectively). +
   Expected: No map will be displayed if this is the first command ran. Otherwise, no changes will be made to the displayed map.

=== Putting a ship

. Putting a ship on the map after initialising the map.

.. Prerequisites: There are ships in your fleet ready to be deployed. This means that the number of battleships in the fleet is more than 0. The map is initialised to a size between 6 and 10.
.. Test case: `put n/destroyer r/horizontal c/b1` +
   Expected: Destroyer battleship of size 3 will be put horizontally on coordinates `b1`, `b2` and `b3`. The map is updated with 3 black cells on each of these coordinates representing the Destroyer battleship.
.. Test case: `put n/aircraft carrier r/horizontal c/c1 t/bluefleet` +
   Expected: Aircraft Carrier battleship of size 5 will be put horizontally on coordinates `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` and `c5`. The map is updated with 5 black cells on each of these coordinates representing the Aircraft Carrier battleship.
.. Test case: `put n/aircraft carrier r/horizontal c/e1 t/nomore` +
   Expected: No battleship is put down on the map. Error details shown in the status message. Map remains the same.
.. Test case: `put n/destroyer r/vertical c/b1` +
   Expected: No battleship is put down on the map. Error details shown in the status message. Map remains the same.
.. Test case: `put n/destroyer r/vertical c/a1` +
   Expected: No battleship is put down on the map. Error details shown in the status message. Map remains the same.
.. Test case: `put n/destroyer r/vertical c/z1` +
   Expected: No battleship is put down on the map. Error details shown in the status message. Map remains the same.

=== Viewing the statistics

To test the `stats` feature. We will perform a before and after check to see if the statistical data of a simple behaviour is captured. In this case, we will perform an attack with a miss result.

1. Initialize a 8x8 map using `init 8`.
2. Run the `stats` command and observe the results
.. Test case : `stats`  (before) +
   Expected: All fields are 0.
3. Now input `attack c1` to simulate an attack on the enemy map.
.. Test case : `stats` (after) +
    Expected: Number of attacks : 1, Number of Misses : 1
