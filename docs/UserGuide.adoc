**What is the Food Diary? **

The Food Diary (FD) is a desktop app for storing your personal food reviews and obtain food recommendations based on your past reviews.


**Why use the Food Diary? **

FD is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FD can get your foodie tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Additionally, FD also stores your data locally, ensuring that your privacy is protected.

Some of the features that can look forward to:

* Keeping track of restaurants you've visited.
* Getting an aggregate rating over all your visits.
* Finding out about new restaurants near you for your next gastronomical adventure!
