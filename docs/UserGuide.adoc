== Introduction

=== PDF++ ?

PDF++ is a desktop application that is meant for anyone who wants or needs a convenient tool that helps them manage all the documents in their computer.
This application can be used by both *Text Input (TI)* and a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*
hence, both technical users and casual users can enjoy a comfortable experience using our program. All the features provided by our application can be used via the *TI* and relevant feedback, based on your input, will be displayed in the <<app-layout, Output Area>> of the application.

[NOTE]
The current version of our application supports PDF documents only. However, we aim to provide
support for many more file types in the future.

=== Proper Usage of PDF++
PDF++ aims to replace your existing File Management System, all operations concerning file management
should be done through the application. In order to ensure smooth user experience, you should not perform any
file manipulation actions on the files themselves. It is recommended that once you add a file to our application, you should
only make changes to those files through our application to prevent the application from misbehaving.

Furthermore, due to security features provided by the Operating Systems, some actions cannot be performed on the
files if they are currently opened (In any PDF Viewer). Please ensure that your files are closed prior to performing any actions
on them.

This File Management System plans to enhance your typical experience managing your documents and
it strives to be the last document manager you will ever need. It includes a multitude of
functions that will elevate your PDF reading and management experience.
You can refer to the table of contents on the left side of this screen to indulge in the many features provided by our app and with many more to come!
Are you fascinated by PDF++? What are you waiting for?
Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

[NOTE]
The words "app" and "application" are used interchangeably in this document and mainly refer to the PDF++
Application.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `pdfplusplus.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your PDF++.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
[#app-layout]

.Individual File Representation
image::UGPdfCard.png[width="500"]
+
.  Type any commands in the Input Area, also known as the Command Box, highlighted by the Orange area and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* in the command box and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open this PDF++ User Guide.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `list` : Lists all files currently managed in PDF++.
* `help`: Opens the User Guide.
* `delete INDEX`: deletes the file indexed at `index` on the list and all its relevant information from PDF++.
* `exit` : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

CAUTION: Please ensure that you have the permissions to Read, Write and
Execute the files that you wish to manage through our application. You may use
a web search, like Google, to assist you in identifying if you possess the relevant
permissions. If you are lacking these permissions our application may not be
able to carry out the actions you specify.

WARNING: Please do not manipulate the files once you have added them to our
application. Unforeseen actions such as moving, renaming and others might result
in unexpected behaviour by the application. Our application is meant to replace
the need for you to perform these actions manually on your files yourselves.

[WARNING]
If your file is open please close it before proceeding to perform ANY other actions in the application.
If the file is kept open, the application may misbehave as it is sharing access to the file with other unknown applications.

[TIP]
Certain commands may take a longer time to run depending on the size of the files that you are dealing with. Hence the Operating System
may wrongly detect that the application is not responding, when it in fact is. Hence, should you see the "application not responding"
pop-up from the operating system, it is actually still working in the background. Therefore, please allow the application some time
to complete the task that you have assigned it. Thank you.

====
*Command Format*

* Texts such as `f/` or `t/` or `date/` and are prefixes that signify information that is required by a particular command.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the additional information that you need to input e.g. in `add f/FILENAME`, `FILENAME` is a parameter which you need to input.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times or zero times e.g. `t/TAG...` can be left blank or used multiple times, `t/TagA t/TagB t/TagC` etc.
* ALL Commands are to be entered in the <<app-layout, Input Area>> that is highlighted in Orange.
* ALL Responses to your input Commands will be displayed in the <<app-layout, Output Area>> that is highlighted in blue.

[#command-help]
=== Viewing the User Guide : `help`

Format: `help` +
The help command displays this page for any references you may need or questions that you may require answers to.

[#command-add]
=== Adding a file: `add`

The add command allows you to add a file through *TI* into to the application, or through the *GUI*. +
The added file will appear in the <<app-layout, Files Section>>, highlighted in green, shown above. +

NOTE: Files with the same name can be added to our application provided that
they are not in the same directory. Just as any Operating System would allow the
existence of files with the same name in different directories.

The Add feature has the following syntax:

[.big]#Format: `add`#

[.big]#Format: `add f/PATH_TO_FILE`#

* `PATH_TO_FILE` refers to the path to the `Pdf` you wish to add
* Entering `add` without `f/PATH_TO_FILE` will open the file
selection *GUI* for the user to `add` a file to our application.
* The file must be a *PDF* file (with .pdf extension).

Example:

* `add f/C:\Users\Raj\Documents\Tutorial3.pdf` [Windows Operating System]
* `add f//Users/raj/Desktop/CS2101 Lecture.pdf` [Mac / Linux Operating System]
* `add` [Any Operating System]

[NOTE]
Please ensure that you have entered the full `PATH_TO_FILE`. Please refer to
<<steps-add,`Step-by-Step Guide`>> below for a detailed guide on the steps necessary
to obtain the full `PATH_TO_FILE`.

[#steps-add]
==== Step-by-Step Guide
Illustrated below is a sample usage scenario that provides a clear view of the inner
workings of the Add feature.

Step 1: Launch the application by double-clicking the `pdfplusplus.jar`. To view the following screen.

[NOTE]

The `history` command allows you to view the list of commands that are previously entered
into the application.

[.big]#Format: `history`# +

Example:

* `history` +

[TIP]
If your previous command was `encrypt` or `decrypt`, the commands will not be saved to the
application as part of a security concern. A malicious user could potentially refer to the
history to get your password, hence the ability to refer back to these commands was removed.

[#command-filter]
=== Filter files by tags: `filter`

The filter command shows you only the files that contain the tags specified in the `filter` command. +

[.big]#Format: `filter t/TAG...`#

* `TAG` refers to the tag you wish to filter the files by. +

* The order of the tags does not matter. e.g. `t/Lecture t/Week_1` will match `t/Week_1 t/Lecture`.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Urgent` will not match `UrgentFiles`.
* File matching at least one of the input tags will be shown.

[NOTE]
Using filter without any tag specified i.e. `filter t/` will return an empty list since there is no tag to reference.

****

[#command-find]
=== Finding Content: `find`

The find command allows you to `find` for files that contain a keyword or phrase
OR `find` files which contain the entered keyword or phrase inside it.

[#find-format]
[.big]#Format: `find KEYWORD`#

* `KEYWORD` refers to the word that you wish to search for within the files of the application.

Examples:

* `find Introduction` +
* `find Author: George RR Martin`

[NOTE]
`find Author: George RR Martin` will not only search for the whole word but also parts of the word
such as `George`, `RR`, `Martin` without regard for the upper or lowercase of the input text. Hence,
a file with the word `correct` will also be flagged as containing `RR`.

[#steps-find]
==== Step-By-Step Guide
If, for example, you wish to locate the files that contain the word `Introduction`
in its name or files that contain the word `Introduction` in its internal content.
You may carry out the following steps in order to get your desired list of files. +

Step 1: Launch the application by double-clicking the `pdfplusplus.jar`. To view the following screen.

[NOTE]
Files you observe may be different and depends on the actions you have previously carried out on our application

.Find Command Step 1 & Step 2
image::UGFindFeatureImage1.png[width="600"]

Step 2:

* As shown by the image, your application should contain an existing list of files.
* You are to key in the `find` command followed by the keyword as illustrated by the command
<<command-find, format>>.

Step 3:

* Finally, press kbd:[Enter] and give the application a short time to sieve through all the files
it manages and locate the relevant ones for you.
* Once the application is done with the task, the following screen should be visible to you.

.Find Command Step 3
image::UGFindFeatureImage2.png[width="600"]

As seen in the image, the files that are relevant to your search will be displayed on the top
left. These files are those that contain the keyword `Introduction` in its name, and files which
contain the keyword within its content. +

The application also shows you other useful information such as, the number of files that
match the criteria you entered into the application as shown in the image above. +

And with that, you have successfully utilized the `find` feature. +

[CAUTION]
When there are many files tracked by the application or if the files tracked by the application
contain many pages, the `find` command might take a little longer to operate. Hence if your
operating system warns you that the application is not responding, please give the application some time
to finish its operation.

[WARNING]
As part of a security measure, all files that are encrypted will not be subject to the `find` command.
This will prevent any information about your secure files from being leaked to malicious users.


[#command-encdec]
=== File Protection: `encrypt` & `decrypt`

PDF++ offers native support for file protection.
The command `encrypt` allows you to protect your files with a password such that
they cannot be accessed without the password that you had specified.
Similarly, the command `decrypt` allows you to remove the password that
you had set for the file.

[NOTE]
The terms `protect` and `encrypt` have the same meaning and will be used
interchangeably.

The *Encrypt* and *Decrypt* feature has the following syntax:

[.big]#Format: `encrypt INDEX password/PASSWORD` [For Encryption]# +
[.big]#Format: `decrypt INDEX password/PASSWORD` [For Decryption]#

* `INDEX` refers to the index of the file on the list that you wish to encrypt/decrypt.
* `PASSWORD` refers to the password which you wish to assign to the particular file.

Examples:

* `encrypt 2 password/ThisIsNotASecurePassword`
* `decrypt 2 password/ThisIsNotASecurePassword`

Please refer to <<steps-encrypt, Encryption Guide>> or <<steps-decrypt, Decryption Guide>>
for help in using these features.

[#steps-encrypt]

decrypts your file as shown below.

.Decrypt Command Step 4
image::DecryptFeatureStep5Success.png[width="600"]

[#command-merge]
=== Merging Files: `merge`
With the `merge` command , you can merge two or more files into a new single file.

The Merge feature has the following syntax:

[.big]#Format: `merge INDEX1 INDEX2 ...`#

* `INDEX` refers to the index of the `Pdf` that you wish to merge.
* Minimum of two index values have to be provided to the application.
* It is possible to repeat an index value, the PDF would simply merge with a copy of itself.

Examples:

* `merge 1 2 3`
* `merge 1 2 1`
* `merge 1 1`

[NOTE]
The newly created file will be stored in the directory of the `INDEX` that was first specified.

[WARNING]
If the combined file size is > 100MB, the operation will take more than a minute to execute. Please
give the application some time to completely execute the operation.

[#steps-merge]
==== Step-By-Step Guide
Illustrated below is a sample usage scenario that provides a clear view to the inner
workings of the `merge` feature.

Step 1: Launch the application by double clicking the `pdfplusplus.jar`. To view the following screen.

[NOTE]
Files you observe may be different and depends on the actions you have previously carried out on our application

Step 2: From the main interface of the application, the user chooses the file(s) that
they wish to merge, and enters the `merge` command into the *TI*, following
the outlined syntax as illustrated below.

.Merge Command Step 2
image::MergeFeatureStep1.png[width="600"]

Step 3: After executing the command, the above two files will be merged, with the _"CS2103T_PDF++_UG_Intro.pdf"_
file attached behind your other selected file.

Step 4: The *MergeCommand* is then executed. The new name of the merged file follows the format: "merged[hashcode].pdf",
where hashcode is a random string of letters and numbers. This prevents any naming conflicts between files.

== Upcoming Features in v2.0
* Connection to External Servers: +
We plan to allow you to connect directly to your cloud servers to synchronize documents across several devices. +
These servers include popular sites such as LumiNus.
* Login Page: +
We plan to include a Login Page to help authenticate you to the application so that you can access the app more securely. +
Furthermore, together with the connection to external servers feature, this feature will allow you to access your documents
anywhere you are.
* Text-to-Speech: +
We plan to implement a Text-to-Speech option that could potentially read the contents of your file or the name of your file to you.
* Multiple File Formats: +
We plan to allow you to use our application with file-types beyond `.pdf` files.
* Undo/Redo: +
Due to some security concerns that we faced with the undo/redo feature, it will be delayed until we have found a solution
that will not compromise the privacy of our users.
