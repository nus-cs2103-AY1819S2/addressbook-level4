HMS+

== PROJECT: HMS+

---

== Overview

HMS+ is a hotel management system made for hotels to manage their customers and their relevant transactions.
The hotel staff interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and has around 15k LOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the complete backend for the booking and reservation from commands upto storage
** What it does: It allows the hotel staff to add service-bookings and reservations for the customers.
** Justification: This is the backbone of the application as these are the main amenities of any hotel.
** Highlights: This enhancement required in-depth analysis of the codebase as it involved extending a single-model dependent system to a multi-model based system.
I had to make sure the design implementation preserved the extensibility of the system as well as allowed the different components to interact with each other.
** Credits: I mainly used the concepts from the existing codebase and those that were taught in CS2103T to implement my features.

** Documentation:
*** Added command formats and descriptions to the user guide.
*** Added color-coding to the user guide.
*** Reformated all the commands to match an intuitive convention in guides and codebase.
*** Added sections to developer guide.
https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-t12-1/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#41-adding-service-booking-functionality[Example] - I added a section to teach oncoming developers how to extend on the codebase.
** Tools:
*** Set Up Travis, Codacy and Coveralls
*** Set the minimum requirements for code to be merged to master.
