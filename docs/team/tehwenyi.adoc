== Introduction

image::about.png[width="130"]

*ePiggy* is a desktop application designed to inculcate good spending habits in students
through allowing them to track their finances. It includes everything from tracking expenses, managing budgets
to setting goals. +

It is written in Java. Interactions by users are done through the Command Line Interface (CLI) and it has a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It can be used on both Windows and Mac. +

*_ePiggy_* is a product of twin modules CS2101 and CS2103T. It was transformed from the
link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4] application.
My team consists of 5 members, including myself. +

== Summary of contributions
|===
|_This section summarises my contributions to ePiggy's code and showcases my technical abilities._
|===

=== Major Enhancement

I added the `budget` feature of ePiggy, which consists of 3 commands: `addBudget`, `editBudget` and `deleteBudget`. +

image::whatitdoes.png[width="150"]

* The `budget` feature allows users to set a limit on their spendings for a specified time period and displays to users
the status of their spendings in relation to their set budget(s).
* The budgets set by the user are viewed as a list. +

image::justification.png[width="150"]

* The `budget` feature urges users to be more aware of the amount they spend per time period so that they can avoid
splurging. +
* Also, unlike typical expense trackers with only one budget, ePiggy's `budget` feature consists of a list of
budgets so that users can see their past spending habits and plan for future budgets.

image::highlights.png[width="150"]

* This enhancement was built from scratch. It is completely new and hence required the creation of many new objects
including `budget`, `period`, `uniqueBudgetList` and a new `budgetPanel` for the UI. This enhancement required me to be
familiar with almost all the different aspects of the code (`commons`, `logic`, `model`, `ui`).

=== Minor Enhancement
Added the status and reminder components of the `budget` feature.

image::whatitdoes.png[width="150"]

* The `budget` feature will display the status of the budget (remaining amount, remaining days) and provide reminders
when users are going to or have spent more than the limit. +

* *_ePiggy_*'s objective is to inculcate good spending habits in our users. Hence, users need to be constantly aware of
their spendings, especially in relation to the budget they have set.

* For this enhancement, the UI is important as it should be simple yet contain enough information. It was challenging to
make the UI simple and concise for our target users whilst conveying the crucial information.

=== Code Contributed
As of 15th April 2019, I have contributed over 60 Pull Requests.

* *Standardised and improved the aesthetics of the User Guide*

I designed and added the header and images across the user guide to make it more
inviting and reader friendly, considering that our target users are students. Below are some examples of my designs:

.Header and section headers added in the User Guide to increase readability and better engage our target audience

* *Contributed content to the User Guide*

I wrote the *Introduction* of the User Guide, making sure it is clear, concise and engaging.
Also, I wrote the *Budgeting* feature which teaches users how to use the `budget` commands in a clear and informative
manner. My contributions for the *Budgeting* feature can be found below, in Sections 3.1 to 3.3.
