== PROJECT: MediTabs

== Introduction
This  Project Portfolio shows my contributions to the group project, such as features and documentation.


== Overview

The group project, Meditabs, is a medicine inventory management for pharmacist to streamline the process of handling the stick taking process. The user mainly uses the Command-Line Interface (CLI) to interact.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the `Label` command
** What it does: Allows the user to output the information of the medicine onto a Portable Document Format (PDF).
** Justification: Pharmacist would like to have the printed information of certain medicine and label the physical counterpart. With the PDF, the pharmacist may use external printers and print out the information on the label as a sticker. PDF is widely used as a file extension.
** Highlights: Added security layer to the naming of the file (Auto include .pdf extension) such that users may not over write other important files.
** Credits: Apache PDFBox external library is imported to help manipulate and output the stream of information to the PDF file.

* *Minor enhancement*: -
